terms:
  - term: "Preferred Stock"
    def: "A class of ownership in a company that has superior rights, privileges, and protections compared to common stock. VCs receive preferred stock, which typically includes rights related to liquidity preference (getting their money back first in a sale) and control."
  - term: "Common Stock"
    def: "The most basic form of equity ownership in a company, typically held by founders and employees. It does not have the special economic and control rights associated with preferred stock."
takeaways: "Any financing negotiation, especially in a venture deal, fundamentally revolves around just two key concepts: economics (who gets what money and when) and control (who gets to make decisions). Understanding this allows an entrepreneur to focus on the most critical terms and identify inexperienced investors who might get bogged down in less important details."

### The Blueprint for the Deal
The term sheet is the critical blueprint for the future relationship between the entrepreneur and the investor, not just a preliminary letter of intent. The terms agreed upon in this document usually determine the final deal structure. While VCs will negotiate many terms, the most critical ones can be categorized into two areas.

### The Two Core Concepts: Economics and Control
Fundamentally, venture capital negotiations center on two things: economics and control.
* **Economics** refers to the terms that dictate the ultimate financial return investors will receive in a liquidity event (such as a sale of the company, a shutdown, or an IPO).
* **Control** refers to the mechanisms that allow investors to either affirmatively direct the business or veto certain decisions the company makes.

If an investor is arguing intensely over a term that doesn't substantively impact either economics or control, they may be inexperienced or simply using a negotiating tactic. An investor's focus on unimportant terms can be a red flag about what they will be like to work with as a partner in the business.

### Key Structures and Terminology
When companies are created, founders and employees receive **common stock**. In contrast, VCs almost always purchase **preferred stock** when they invest. Preferred stock carries special economic and control rights not granted to common stockholders. A holder of preferred stock can typically choose to convert their shares to common stock at any time, but the reverse is not possible.

Financing rounds are usually given a series letter. The first significant round is often called the **Series A** financing, though an earlier, smaller round called a **Series Seed** financing has become common. Subsequent rounds are lettered sequentially (Series B, Series C, etc.). Sometimes a number is added (e.g., Series B-1) to denote a follow-on round without moving to the next letter. While the book focuses on these equity financings, another instrument called **convertible debt** acts as a temporary loan that is intended to convert into equity during a future financing round.
