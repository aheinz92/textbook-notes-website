terms:
  - term: "Convertible Debt / Note / Loan"
    def: "These terms are often used interchangeably. 'Convertible Debt' is the financial concept of a loan that converts into equity. A 'Convertible Note' is the specific legal document detailing the loan's terms. For practical purposes in this context, they all refer to the same thing: raising money via a loan that will turn into company ownership later."
  - term: "Applicable Federal Rates (AFRs)"
    def: "The minimum interest rates for private loans, published monthly by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). To prevent tax avoidance through interest-free 'gift' loans, any private loan - including a startup's convertible note - must have an interest rate at or above the AFR. Setting a rate below the AFR can create unintended tax liabilities for both the investor and the company, so compliance is standard practice."
  - term: "Accelerator"
    def: "A program that provides early-stage startups with mentorship, resources, and a small amount of seed funding in exchange for an equity stake. Accelerators typically run for a fixed period (e.g., three months) and culminate in a 'Demo Day' where the startups pitch to a larger group of potential investors."
  - term: "Supermajority"
    def: "A voting threshold that requires a significantly higher level of approval than a simple majority (over 50%). A supermajority might require a two-thirds (66.7%) or three-quarters (75%) vote, giving a substantial minority of stakeholders the power to block a decision."
  - term: "Pro Rata"
    def: "A Latin term meaning 'in proportion.' For example, a pro rata right gives an investor the opportunity to purchase a proportional number of shares in a future funding round, allowing them to maintain their percentage of ownership in the company."
takeaways: "Convertible debt is a tool for raising capital quickly by deferring the difficult negotiation over a startup's valuation. While it simplifies the initial investment, it introduces its own complexity through terms like the valuation cap and discount, which are meant to balance the risk and reward between founders and early investors. The key lesson is that this is not a 'simple' alternative to a priced round, but rather a different set of trade-offs that can significantly impact future fundraising and ownership. Understanding this concept shows how risk and future potential can be structured into a deal, a useful lesson for evaluating any high-risk, high-reward opportunity."

### What is Convertible Debt?
Convertible debt is a loan to a company that is designed to convert into equity (ownership) at a later date, typically during a future equity financing round. Its main appeal is that it allows a company and its earliest investors (like angels or accelerators) to postpone setting a specific valuation for the business. Instead of agreeing on a price per share today, the debt holders are promised shares in the future, often at a discount to the price paid by later investors, as a reward for their early-risk taking. For example, if an investor loans $500,000 via a convertible note with a 20% discount and the next financing round is priced at $1.00 per share, the note holder's investment would convert into shares at a price of $0.80 per share.

### Arguments for and Against Convertible Debt
The primary argument for convertible debt is its speed and simplicity compared to a priced equity round, which can reduce legal fees and avoid early, difficult negotiations about valuation. However, the choice is not simple for either the entrepreneur or the investor.

From an investor's perspective, forgoing a priced round means they might end up paying a higher effective price if the company becomes very successful before the next financing. To mitigate this risk, investors often insist on a **valuation cap**, which sets a maximum valuation at which their debt can convert, regardless of how high the next round's valuation is.

For entrepreneurs, while deferring the valuation discussion might seem advantageous, it has pitfalls. A valuation cap can act as an anchor, causing future investors to peg their offer to the cap, potentially resulting in a lower Series A valuation than what the company might have otherwise achieved. This can be particularly damaging since the Series A round is typically much larger than the seed round. Furthermore, while a high valuation in the next round seems like a win, it can significantly dilute the ownership of the earliest, most supportive investors, which might not be the desired outcome. The debate over whether convertible debt truly benefits the entrepreneur or the investor is ongoing, with valid arguments on both sides.

### The Discount
The discount is a key feature of convertible debt, rewarding early investors for taking on risk before a formal valuation is set. It allows their investment to convert into equity at a lower price per share than the investors in the subsequent financing round. The typical range for this discount is 10% to 30%, with 20% being the most common. This is usually implemented as a direct price reduction (e.g., converting at 80% of the next round's price). While more complex structures exist, such as discounts that increase over time, a simple, fixed discount is standard for most seed rounds.

### Valuation Caps
A valuation cap is an investor-friendly term that sets a ceiling on the valuation at which a convertible note converts into equity. This protects early investors from situations where a company's valuation skyrockets before their note converts. For example, if an investor puts in money thinking the company is worth around $4 million, but the next financing round values it at $20 million, a 20% discount alone would still result in a high effective valuation of $16 million. A valuation cap of, say, $4 million would ensure the investor's note converts as if the company were valued at $4 million, giving them a much larger ownership stake and rewarding their early risk. While entrepreneurs prefer uncapped notes, a reasonably negotiated cap can help align the interests of the founder and seed investors.

### Interest Rate
Since convertible debt is technically a loan, it accrues interest. This interest is considered part of the compensation for the investor, but it's secondary to the conversion discount. Interest rates are typically low, often just above the legally required minimums set by the Applicable Federal Rates (AFRs). A common range is between 5% and 12%, with 8% being typical.

### Conversion Mechanics
For a convertible note to automatically convert into equity, a "Qualified Financing" must occur. This is typically defined by two main conditions: a minimum amount of new capital raised (e.g., $1 million) and a timeframe in which this must happen (the "Maturity Date," often 6-12 months). If these conditions are not met by the maturity date, the debt remains outstanding. In this scenario, the note holders' consent is required for any future action, making the amendment provisions in the note - specifically, whether a simple majority or a supermajority of note holders is required to approve changes - very important.

### Conversion in a Sale of the Company
If the company is acquired before the convertible debt converts, the loan documents must specify what happens. There are three common scenarios:
1.  The note holders get their principal plus accrued interest back. They receive no upside from the acquisition.
2.  The note holders receive their principal and interest, plus a pre-negotiated multiple (e.g., 2x or 3x) of their investment.
3.  The debt converts into equity at a pre-determined valuation (often the valuation cap) immediately before the sale, allowing the note holders to participate in the acquisition upside.

It is crucial to define these terms clearly upfront to avoid complexity and conflict during an acquisition.

### Warrants
Warrants are an alternative to a simple discount, though they are more complex and less common in seed rounds today. A warrant is an option to purchase a certain number of shares at a predetermined price. Instead of a 20% discount, an investor might receive 20% "warrant coverage," meaning a warrant to buy additional stock worth 20% of their initial loan amount. This structure introduces complexities regarding the type of stock the warrant is for (common or preferred) and its exercise price. Warrants also have additional terms like their expiration date and what happens in a merger. A critical rule for entrepreneurs is to never let an investor "double dip" by receiving both a discount and warrants.

### Other Terms
More sophisticated investors may ask for additional rights in a convertible debt deal.
* **Pro Rata Rights:** The right for an investor to participate in future financing rounds to maintain their ownership percentage. Sometimes investors ask for "super pro rata" rights to invest even more than their proportional share.
* **Liquidation Preference:** In some cases, particularly for struggling companies raising a "bridge loan," investors may demand a liquidation preference, ensuring they get their money back (or a multiple) before other shareholders in a sale.

### Early Stage versus Late Stage Dynamics
While convertible debt is now common for seed deals, it was traditionally used by later-stage companies for "bridge financings" - short-term loans to bridge the company to its next major financing round or an acquisition. In these riskier, later-stage scenarios, the terms are often tougher and may include liquidation preferences or changes in control.

### Can Convertible Debt Be Dangerous?
Raising money via debt can make a company technically insolvent on its balance sheet (liabilities exceed assets). Under corporate law, when a company is insolvent, the board's fiduciary duties can shift from protecting shareholders to protecting creditors. This creates a prolonged period of legal risk, as any actions taken by the directors could be scrutinized by creditors (including disgruntled ex-employees) if the company eventually fails. In some states, this can even lead to personal liability for directors.

### An Alternative to Convertible Debt
To avoid the legal issues of debt (like insolvency and maturity dates), instruments like the **SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity)** were created. A SAFE is not debt; it is a promise for future equity, functioning much like an unpriced warrant. It can include a valuation cap and/or a discount, just like a convertible note, but eliminates the concepts of interest and a maturity date. This simplifies the process, but the lack of a maturity date also removes a key point of leverage for investors to force a check-in conversation if a company is struggling.
