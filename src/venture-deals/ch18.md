takeaways: "Legal agreements like term sheets are not merely defensive legal paperwork; they are critical tools for aligning incentives between parties from the outset. Understanding that contracts are designed to constrain bad behavior, reduce future transaction costs, and manage information imbalances is a crucial skill for any business relationship, not just fundraising."

### Why Do Term Sheets Even Exist?
While it is possible to do a deal on a handshake followed by standard legal forms, this is the exception. Term sheets and the extensive legal documents that follow are a standard part of venture financing. This is because VCs are accountable to their own investors (LPs) and auditors, who require formal documentation to protect the investment. Furthermore, courts rarely give VCs the benefit of the doubt in contract disputes, so any desired provision must be explicitly stated in writing. The ultimate purpose of these documents is to align incentives between the entrepreneur and the investor so both parties are motivated to act in ways that are mutually beneficial.

### Constraining Behavior and the Alignment of Incentives
Business relationships are driven by self-interest. A good contract acknowledges this and creates a win-win situation where both parties are incentivized to act in each otherâ€™s best interests. When incentives are not aligned, problems can arise, such as during an acquisition where founders, VCs, and employees may have conflicting financial interests. These misalignments should be addressed openly, but the contract serves as the ultimate boundary for behavior. The economic and control provisions in a term sheet are the primary mechanisms for aligning incentives and constraining potentially harmful behavior. A powerful negotiation tactic is to frame an objection to a term not as "off-market," but as something that creates a misalignment of incentives from the start of the relationship.

### Transaction Costs
Transaction costs are the expenses, in both time and money, associated with creating a business relationship. This includes legal fees, time spent in meetings, and the effort of conducting due diligence. Over the past few decades, these costs have decreased due to industry standardization of documents and improved technology for communication. A well-structured contract aims to minimize both current and future transaction costs. For example, negotiating a detailed letter of intent (LOI) for a merger upfront can save significant time and money later by reducing ambiguity when drafting the final binding documents.

### Agency Costs and Information Asymmetry
Agency costs arise when one party (the agent, e.g., a CEO) acts on behalf of another (the principal, e.g., a VC). These costs can be indirect and subtle. A "walking dead" company (one that is not growing but not failing) is a classic example. The CEO (agent) is incentivized to keep the company alive to maintain their salary and position, while the VC (principal) might prefer to shut it down to recover any remaining capital and take a tax loss. This conflict is worsened by information asymmetry, where each party knows more about their own business and motivations than the other does. Contractual provisions like giving the VC a board seat, ensuring an odd number of board members with an independent director, or including redemption rights can help mitigate these agency problems by increasing oversight and providing the investor with more leverage.

### Reputation Constraints
In a small, interconnected industry like venture capital, reputation can be a more powerful constraint on behavior than any contract clause. Both investors and entrepreneurs develop reputations over time based on how they handle ambiguity, conflict, and negotiations. Bad behavior, even if not public, gets discussed within the community. Therefore, conducting due diligence on the reputation of the people you are about to partner with is one of the most critical aspects of any deal.
