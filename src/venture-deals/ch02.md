terms:
  - term: "Pass-through tax entity"
    def: "A business structure (like an LLC or S Corp) where the company's profits and losses are passed directly to the owners' personal tax returns, avoiding a separate corporate-level income tax. VCs typically do not invest in these."
  - term: "Securities"
    def: "Financial instruments that hold monetary value and represent an ownership position in a company (stock), a creditor relationship (bonds), or rights to ownership (options). For a startup, this includes common stock, preferred stock, and stock options."
  - term: "Chain of Title (for IP)"
    def: "A clear, documented history that proves the ownership of a piece of intellectual property. For a startup, it means showing how all IP was legally transferred from its creators - such as founders, employees, and contractors - to the company itself."
  - term: "PIIA (Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement)"
    def: "A binding contract that employees and founders sign to protect a company's confidential information and to formally assign ownership of any inventions they create, related to the business, to the company."
takeaways: "Proactive legal and organizational preparation is non-negotiable before seeking funding. By establishing the correct corporate structure, organizing documents, and securing all intellectual property rights upfront, entrepreneurs can avoid costly and deal-killing mistakes. This principle of diligence and 'getting your house in order' is a crucial skill for any business or project, not just venture-backed startups."

### Choosing the Right Lawyer
A startup's lawyer is a critical, long-term partner who guides the company through its entire lifecycle. When selecting one, prioritize experience in representing startups, as these attorneys understand common legal hurdles and are often well-connected to investors and other resources. While cost is a factor, an efficient, experienced lawyer is more valuable than a cheaper, less-specialized one. Most importantly, choose a lawyer you trust and have a good personal connection with, as they will be privy to your most sensitive business details and will act as a representative of your company.

### Proactive versus Reactive
Entrepreneurs must proactively prepare their company for the rigorous due diligence process of a venture financing round to avoid unexpected challenges. This preparation is key to meeting investor expectations.

A fundamental requirement is structuring the company as a **Delaware C Corporation**. Venture capitalists (VCs) typically cannot or will not invest in pass-through tax entities like LLCs or S Corps, so companies must convert to a C Corp structure before approaching investors. Delaware is the universally accepted standard for the state of incorporation. Additionally, the company must be legally qualified to do business in every state where it has operations.

Before fundraising, the management team should create a **data site** (e.g., a shared folder in Dropbox or Google Drive) containing all essential legal and financial records. This ensures that when investors begin their due diligence, the information is organized and readily accessible. Key documents to include are:
- **Organizational Documents:** The Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and all board and shareholder minutes.
- **Capitalization Records:** A detailed capitalization table (cap table) listing all company securities (stock, options, etc.) and their owners, along with any agreements granting special rights to stockholders.
- **Financial and Operational Records:** Financial statements, budgets, major customer lists, and all employment agreements.

The team should review these documents in advance to ensure they are all properly signed and executed, fixing any issues before they become problems during a high-stakes financing negotiation.

### Intellectual Property
A company's intellectual property (IP) - which includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets - is often its most valuable asset and a key factor for investors. It is absolutely critical to demonstrate a clear, documented **chain of title** for all IP, proving the company owns it outright.

To secure this chain of title, anyone who has had contact with the company's IP must sign agreements with confidentiality and IP assignment provisions. This includes founders, employees, contractors, and even external advisors. A single missing IP assignment agreement can cause a venture deal to fail.

A common and significant pitfall occurs when founders develop their startup's IP while still employed by another company. The "Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement" signed with a previous employer may grant that employer ownership of the new IP. Founders must make a "clean break" from prior jobs to avoid these ownership conflicts. Ideally, a founder should obtain a signed release from their former employer; otherwise, they should leave that job as soon as possible.

- **Employees (including founders)** must sign a Proprietary Inventions and Assignment Agreement.
- **Contractors and service providers** must sign agreements that assign any IP they create to the company.
- **Advisors** must also sign agreements to maintain confidentiality and assign IP ownership, preventing them from later claiming to be a co-inventor or, in worst-case scenarios, stealing the IP.
