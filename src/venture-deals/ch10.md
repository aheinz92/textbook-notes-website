terms:
  - term: "Broker"
    def: "A licensed individual or firm that acts as an intermediary between a company issuing securities and investors. In the context of Title III crowdfunding, a registered funding portal or broker-dealer is required to host the offering and process investments, ensuring compliance with regulations."
  - term: "Protective Provisions"
    def: "A set of rights included in a term sheet that allows investors to veto certain major corporate actions, even if they don't control the board of directors. These provisions protect the investors' interests and typically cover decisions like selling the company, issuing new shares that would dilute the investors, or taking on large amounts of debt."
  - term: "Whitepaper"
    def: "In the context of an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), a whitepaper is an in-depth report that explains the purpose, technology, and goals of a new project. It details the problem being solved, its technical architecture, and the plan for creating and distributing its new crypto token, serving as the primary document to attract investors."
takeaways: "Crowdfunding has evolved from a niche concept into a powerful set of tools for both validating product ideas and raising capital. Understanding the distinction between non-dilutive product crowdfunding (like Kickstarter) and regulated equity crowdfunding (governed by the JOBS Act) is crucial for any entrepreneur, as each path has unique benefits, legal requirements, and potential pitfalls regarding investor management."

Since 2011, crowdfunding has grown from a nascent idea into a powerful financing mechanism for companies, encompassing both product development and equity financing. There are several distinct approaches, each with its own legal framework and strategic implications.

### Product Crowdfunding
Product crowdfunding, popularized by platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, allows a company to fund the development of a physical product by collecting money from "backers." In exchange, backers receive rewards, which often include the product itself once it's manufactured, along with other items like t-shirts or sponsorship recognition. This process is essentially a presale or preorder campaign. A campaign typically has a 30-day funding goal; successfully hitting this target serves as a strong validation that the company has a compelling minimum viable product (MVP). Failure to meet the goal signals that the proposed product is not interesting enough to pursue. High-profile successes like the Pebble Watch and Oculus Rift started on Kickstarter, while some companies like Glowforge have run massive independent preorder campaigns. The primary advantage of this model is that the funding is non-dilutive - the company is preselling a product and receiving cash up front without giving up any ownership or equity. The main risk is failing to deliver the product after a successful campaign, though the culture around product crowdfunding generally understands that this is a possibility.

### Equity Crowdfunding and Regulation
Equity crowdfunding involves an investor giving a company money in exchange for a security (such as stock or debt) through an online platform like AngelList. In the United States, selling a security requires registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) unless a specific exemption applies. The Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act of 2012 modernized these rules, creating new exemptions centered around two key concepts: the "accredited investor" and "general solicitation."
- An **accredited investor** is an individual with a high income (over $200k annually, or $300k with a spouse) or a net worth over $1 million.
- **General solicitation** refers to publicly advertising a fundraise (e.g., at a demo day or via a mass email) to people with whom you don't have a preexisting relationship.

The JOBS Act established three key frameworks for private fundraising:
- **Rule 506(b):** This is the traditional model. There is no cap on the amount raised, general solicitation is forbidden, and investors must be accredited. The regulatory burden is light. Most traditional VC deals and many deals on AngelList fall under this rule.
- **Rule 506(c)/Title II:** This rule also has no fundraising cap and is limited to accredited investors, but it *allows* general solicitation. This enables a company to advertise its fundraise widely, but it comes with a medium regulatory burden, including the need to verify that all investors are accredited.
- **Title III (Regulation Crowdfunding):** This is "true" equity crowdfunding. It allows companies to raise up to $1 million over 12 months from *both accredited and nonaccredited investors*. However, solicitation is restricted to a single, approved online portal or broker, and the regulatory burden is heavy, involving significant disclosure requirements and costs.

### How Equity Crowdfunding Differs from Traditional VC
Raising money from "the crowd" is operationally different from a traditional venture capital financing. In a crowdfunding round, the entrepreneur often sets the financing terms, typically using a simple structure with minimal protective provisions and rarely offering board seats. While a VC provides expertise, mentorship, and network access, a crowdfunding campaign results in a large group of small investors who are often passive. The responsibility for communication and engagement falls entirely on the founder. There is also a risk of being "stranded" if the company raises some money but not enough to reach the next milestone, leaving it too early for VCs and without a committed lead investor to provide support. Finally, founders must be cautious, as the crowd can include unsophisticated or difficult investors who are not constrained by reputation in the same way a professional angel or VC is.

### Token Crowdfunding (ICOs)
Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are a more recent and volatile funding mechanism where a project sells newly created crypto tokens in exchange for cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin) or cash. While ICOs saw a surge in popularity and hype in 2017, they remain a very immature and risky mechanism. Many ICOs have been based on little more than a whitepaper idea, and the space has been subject to intense SEC scrutiny over potential securities law violations as well as several high-profile frauds.
