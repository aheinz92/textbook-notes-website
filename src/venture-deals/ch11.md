  - term: "Prime Rate"
    def: "The benchmark interest rate that major banks charge their most creditworthy corporate customers. It is often used as the basis for calculating the interest rates on variable-rate loans, such as venture debt."
  - term: "Lien"
    def: "A legal claim against a company's assets that is used to secure a debt. If the company defaults, the lender can seize the assets covered by the lien. A 'perfected lien' is a lien that has been properly filed with the appropriate legal authority, giving the lender priority over other creditors in claiming those assets during a bankruptcy or liquidation."
takeaways: "Venture debt is a specialized loan available to venture-backed companies that complements, but does not replace, equity financing. Understanding the difference between debt (which must be repaid) and equity (ownership) is a critical financial literacy skill applicable to any business, as it shows how to use different capital types strategically to fuel growth while managing dilution and maintaining good relationships with capital providers."

### The Role and Rules of Venture Debt
Venture debt is a type of loan designed specifically for high-growth, venture capital-backed companies. It is a complement to equity, not a replacement. While equity is long-term, flexible capital that doesn't have a contractual repayment requirement, debt has defined repayment terms and is structured for specific purposes. The first rule of venture debt is that it follows equity; lenders see VC investment as a validation of the company's potential. The amount of debt available is typically calibrated to the last equity round, often ranging from 25% to 50% of the equity raised. Companies without VC backing, or those that are bootstrapping, will find it very difficult to secure venture debt, as more traditional loans require positive cash flow, which growth-focused startups often lack.

### The Players: Banks vs. Venture Debt Funds
The two primary sources of venture debt are specialized banks (like Silicon Valley Bank) and nonbank lenders called **venture debt funds**. It's crucial to partner with a lender experienced in the startup ecosystem, as an inexperienced lender pulling out of the market can cause significant disruption.
* **Banks** fund their lending through customer deposits, which gives them a lower cost of capital. Consequently, they tend to focus more on structure, financial covenants, and building a long-term banking relationship that includes other financial services.
* **Venture Debt Funds** raise capital from investors, much like VCs. Their cost of capital is higher, so they seek higher returns. This means they often take more risk in exchange for greater cash yield and more significant warrant compensation.

### How Lenders Assess Risk: The Primary Source of Repayment
Lenders categorize loans based on their **Primary Source of Repayment (PSOR)**. Traditional commercial loans rely on a company's positive cash flow or its assets (like accounts receivable) as the PSOR. Neither of these works for a typical startup that is burning cash to achieve growth. For venture debt, the PSOR is the company's **access to future venture capital**. Lenders underwrite the loan based on their confidence in the company's ability to raise its next equity round, which will be used to fund growth and repay the debt. They focus on the same metrics as your VCs: burn rate, runway, and progress toward milestones. Because the PSOR is access to capital, lenders pay close attention to the quality of the VCs on the cap table and their track record.

### Economic Terms of a Venture Debt Deal
The total price of a venture debt deal is an aggregation of several components:
* **Interest Rate:** Almost always a floating rate, quoted as a spread above a benchmark like the **Prime Rate**.
* **Loan Fees:** Typically 0.25% to 0.75% of the loan amount, paid at closing or when funds are drawn.
* **Warrants:** A common and critical form of non-cash compensation for the lender. Warrants give the lender the right to buy equity in the company in the future. The size is often expressed as "warrant coverage" (e.g., 2% of a $2M loan means $40,000 worth of warrants). Key negotiation points include the **strike price** (lenders want the last round's price; entrepreneurs want the next, higher price) and the **duration** (typically 7-10 years).
* **Final Payments:** A lump-sum fee paid at the end of the loan's term, which defers some of the loan's cost for the company.
* **Prepayment Fees:** A penalty for paying the loan off early, often structured on a declining scale (e.g., 3% in year one, 2% in year two, 1% in year three). This incentivizes the company to stay with the lender.

### Amortization Terms: Structuring the Repayment
The repayment schedule is often more critical than the price, as it directly impacts cash flow and runway.
* **Draw Period:** The time window during which the company can request the loan funds. A delayed draw is beneficial as it guarantees access to capital without immediately incurring interest costs.
* **Interest-Only (I/O) Period:** A period, typically 6-12 months, where the company only pays interest and makes no principal payments. This is a powerful tool for extending runway, as it frees up cash for growth. Lenders may offer I/O extensions conditional on the company hitting specific performance milestones.
* **Amortization:** Once the I/O period ends, the company begins repaying the principal, usually in equal monthly installments (**straight-line amortization**) over the remaining term of the loan (e.g., 36 months). Banks are more rigid about these schedules due to regulations, while debt funds have more flexibility to modify terms.

### Control Terms: Covenants and the MAC Clause
Lenders use covenants to manage risk. Early-stage venture loans often have no financial performance covenants, which is why lenders demand warrants as compensation for the higher risk. Later-stage deals might trade warrants for covenants.
* **Affirmative Covenants:** Actions the company promises to take (e.g., pay taxes, provide timely financial reports, maintain insurance).
* **Negative Covenants:** Actions the company agrees not to take without the lender's consent (e.g., sell major assets, take on other debt, merge with another company).
* **Material Adverse Change (MAC) Clause:** This is the most controversial control term. It's a broad, catch-all clause that gives the lender the right to call a default if an unforeseen, significantly negative event occurs that impairs the business or its prospect of repayment. While intended as a fail-safe for extreme circumstances, its subjective nature makes the lender's reputation and relationship critical.
* **Security Interest in IP:** Lenders take a security interest (a lien) in the company's assets as collateral. A key negotiation point is whether this includes the company's core intellectual property. A common compromise is a "negative pledge," where the company does not grant a lien on its IP but promises not to grant one to any other party.

### Negotiation and Restructuring
When negotiating, there's a tension between a transactional approach (running a competitive "bake off" to get the absolute best price) and a relational one (choosing a partner who will be flexible when things inevitably go off-plan). A founder's long-term reputation is paramount. Since forecasts are always wrong, it's highly probable that loan terms will need to be renegotiated. The key to successful restructuring is transparent, early, and frequent communication with the lender - no surprises. When a company's performance falters, a good lender works with the company and its investors to find a solution, whereas a bad one might use the default to opportunistically extract value. In worst-case scenarios ("soft landings" or "wind-downs"), managing the process professionally with the lender is critical for preserving the founders' reputations for future ventures.
