terms:
  - term: "Fiduciary Duty"
    def: "A legal and ethical obligation for one party (such as a board member) to act in the best interests of another party (the company and all its shareholders). This requires prioritizing the company's welfare over any personal interests."
  - term: "Bylaws"
    def: "The internal rules and regulations that govern a company's day-to-day operations. They detail procedures for holding board meetings, electing officers, and other corporate governance matters, supplementing the foundational rules set in the Certificate of Incorporation."
  - term: "Limited Partners (LPs)"
    def: "The primary investors who provide capital to a venture capital fund. Their liability is 'limited' to the amount of their investment, and they do not participate in the daily management of the fund, which is handled by the General Partners (the VCs)."
takeaways: "Beyond the economic terms, a venture deal is defined by control terms that give investors a say in critical company decisions. For a founder, understanding the nuances of board composition, protective provision veto rights, and drag-along clauses is just as important as negotiating valuation, as these terms dictate who truly has power when major strategic choices must be made."

### Introduction to Control Terms
While the previous chapter covered the economic terms of a financing deal, this chapter focuses on control provisions. These terms are crucial for venture capitalists because they are not involved in the company's daily operations but need to influence actions that could materially affect their investment. VCs, despite often owning less than 50% of a company, use these terms to gain effective control over many key activities. The primary control terms discussed are the board of directors, protective provisions, the drag-along agreement, and conversion rights.

### Board of Directors
The board of directors is a company's most powerful management body, holding the authority to fire the CEO and approve major corporate actions like budgets, financings, mergers, and the hiring of C-level executives. The composition of the board is a critical and delicate negotiation point.

A term sheet specifies the board's size and the process for electing its members. Typically, different classes of stock (e.g., Series A Preferred, Common) are granted the right to elect a specific number of directors. A key negotiation revolves around the election of "outside" or "independent" directors—those not affiliated with the company or its major investors. These seats can be filled either by a vote of all shareholders together (favoring the majority owner) or by mutual consent of the existing board (requiring agreement).

Outside directors are valuable for their industry expertise, networking connections, and ability to mediate disputes between founders and investors. Board composition evolves as a company matures:
* **Early-Stage Board (3-5 members):** Typically includes a founder/CEO, a lead VC, and an outside director. A five-person board might add another founder or a second VC. The goal is a balanced board where neither the founders nor the VCs have absolute control.
* **Mature-Stage Board (7-9 members):** As a company approaches an IPO, the board expands to include more outside directors with relevant industry or executive experience.

VCs may also request a "board observer" seat for an associate from their firm. While observers don't vote, they participate in discussions and can influence the board's dynamic. Entrepreneurs are cautioned against letting the board get too large. While board members are reimbursed for expenses, only outside directors are typically compensated, usually with stock options ranging from 0.25% to 0.5% that vest over several years. The authors believe that neither the VC nor the founder should control the board; an independent outside member is crucial for good governance and impartial judgment.

### Protective Provisions
Protective provisions are essentially veto rights granted to investors over a specific list of company actions. These rights "protect" the investors' economic and control position. While once heavily negotiated, the list of provisions has become largely standardized.

A typical clause requires the consent of a majority of the preferred shareholders before the company can:
* Alter the rights or privileges of the preferred stock.
* Change the authorized number of shares (common or preferred).
* Create a new class of stock with rights senior or equal to the existing preferred stock.
* Buy back common stock (with exceptions for employee equity agreements).
* Sell the company or approve another change of control event.
* Amend the company’s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws.
* Change the size of the board of directors.
* Pay dividends.
* Incur debt above a specified amount (e.g., $100,000).
* Declare bankruptcy.
* Sell or license away the company’s core intellectual property.
* Create or issue cryptocurrency tokens (a more recent addition).

A common negotiation point is to raise the debt threshold for more established companies. Lawyers may request "materiality qualifiers" (e.g., to "materially" alter rights), but VCs often reject this, preferring clear, specific language to avoid future debates over what "material" means.

In subsequent financing rounds (e.g., Series B), a key issue is whether the new investors' protective provisions will require a separate vote or if they will vote "as a single class" with the earlier investors. Founders and experienced VCs prefer a single-class vote to prevent a small group of new investors from gaining an independent veto right over company actions. These provisions are not about a lack of trust; they are a governance mechanism to pre-define decision-making rights and separate a VC's role as a board member (with a fiduciary duty to the whole company) from their role as a shareholder (with a duty to their own LPs).

### Drag-Along Agreement
A drag-along agreement forces minority shareholders to consent to a sale of the company if a specific majority group of shareholders approves the transaction. This prevents individual shareholders from holding up a deal.

There are two main types:
1.  **Preferred Drags Common:** The most common form gives preferred stockholders the ability to force common stockholders and founders to agree to a sale. This became prevalent after the dot-com bust, where founders might otherwise block sales that paid out less than the VCs' liquidation preference, leaving founders with nothing.
2.  **Departed Founder Drag-Along:** The authors' preferred version stipulates that if a founder leaves the company, their shares will be voted in the same proportion as all other shares in any future vote. This prevents a potentially disgruntled ex-founder from holding up a future transaction.

The most common compromise for founders is to negotiate that the drag-along is triggered by a majority of *common stock*, not preferred. This ensures they are only forced into a deal that most of their peers also support. Rejecting a drag-along entirely can be a red flag, suggesting a lawyer may be prioritizing a founder's individual interest over the company's collective interest.

### Conversion
Conversion rights are considered non-negotiable in venture deals.

* **Voluntary Conversion:** Preferred stock always includes the right for the holder to convert their shares into common stock at any time, typically at a 1:1 ratio (subject to anti-dilution adjustments). This is a one-way conversion. An investor would exercise this right if a sale would yield them a greater return on an "as-converted" basis than they would receive from their liquidation preference.

* **Automatic Conversion:** This term dictates that all preferred stock will automatically convert into common stock upon a **Qualified IPO (QIPO)**. A QIPO is defined by negotiable thresholds, typically a minimum IPO price (e.g., 3x the original purchase price) and a minimum total offering size (e.g., $15 million). Entrepreneurs prefer lower thresholds for greater flexibility in going public, while investors want higher thresholds to maintain control and ensure a meaningful exit. It is critical that all series of preferred stock have the *exact same* automatic conversion terms. If different series have different thresholds, a later-stage investor could have the power to block an IPO that earlier investors and the company wish to pursue, creating a damaging hold-out situation.
