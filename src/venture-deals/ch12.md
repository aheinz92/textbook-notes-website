  - term: "First Right of Refusal (ROFR)"
    def: "A right that allows an investor to have the first ability to either make another investment in the company or acquire the company. As mentioned in the chapter, this is a form of control often sought by Corporate Venture Capital (CVC) investors during a potential acquisition, and the authors strongly caution entrepreneurs against ever granting this right."
takeaways: "Understanding how a Venture Capital fund is structured, how VCs get paid, and the lifecycle pressures of their funds is critical for any entrepreneur. This knowledge demystifies investor behavior, revealing that VCs have their own bosses (LPs) and are driven by a complex set of incentives (management fees vs. carried interest) and timelines that directly impact their decisions regarding your company. This insight into stakeholder motivation is valuable in any career, as it helps you better negotiate and manage relationships with capital partners."

### Overview of a Typical Structure
A venture capital firm consists of three distinct legal entities. The **management company** is the operating business owned by the senior partners; it employs all staff and pays the firm's expenses. The **limited partnership (LP)** is the actual investment fund, a vehicle containing the capital committed by investors (the Limited Partners). Finally, the **general partnership (GP)** is the legal entity that serves as the manager of the LP fund. Entrepreneurs primarily interact with people employed by the management company, but the investment itself comes from a specific LP fund entity.

### How Firms Raise Money
VCs raise capital from various institutions and individuals known as **Limited Partners (LPs)**, such as pension funds, endowments, and family offices. The relationship is governed by a **Limited Partnership Agreement (LPA)**. When a VC decides to invest in a company, it does not use cash sitting in a bank account; instead, it issues a **capital call**, which is a formal request for its LPs to provide their pro-rata share of the required funds. LPs are legally obligated to fund these calls. If an LP cannot provide the capital, their stake in the fund is often sold to another investor in a **secondary market**.

### How Venture Capitalists Make Money
VC compensation has two primary components: management fees and carried interest. The dynamic between these two components drives much of a VC's behavior.

#### Management Fees
VCs receive an annual **management fee**, typically 1.5% to 2.5% of the total committed capital of a fund. This fee pays for all the firm's operating expenses, including salaries, rent, and travel. For a $100 million fund with a 2% fee, the firm receives $2 million annually. These fees are guaranteed for the life of the fund (usually 10 years), regardless of investment performance. As a firm raises multiple funds over time, the management fees from each fund stack, increasing the firm's total operating budget.

#### Carried Interest
The most significant financial reward for a successful VC is **carried interest**, or "carry," which is their share of the fund's profits. The industry standard is a 20% carry. After the fund returns all of the initial capital to its LPs (e.g., $100 million for a $100 million fund), the VCs receive 20% of all subsequent profits. A **clawback** provision requires VCs to return any carry they have received if the fund's later investments perform poorly and the fund as a whole fails to be profitable. To ensure alignment, VCs are also required to invest their own money into the fund, known as the **GP commitment**, which is typically 1-5% of the total fund size.

### How Time Impacts Fund Activity
A fund's timeline has a major impact on its investment strategy. The **commitment period** is the timeframe, usually the first five years of a fund's life, during which the VC can make *new* investments. After this period, the fund can only make follow-on investments in its existing portfolio companies. The total life of a fund, or its **investment term**, is typically 10 years, though it can be extended. VCs whose funds are past the commitment period and who have been unable to raise a new fund are sometimes called **"zombie VCs,"** as they manage old investments but cannot make new ones. The age of a fund can create pressure on an entrepreneur, as a fund nearing the end of its life may push for a quick exit.

### Reserves and Cash Flow
VCs allocate a portion of their fund as **reserves** for future, follow-on investments in their portfolio companies. A typical strategy might be to invest $50 million of a $100 million fund into initial investments across 10 companies, reserving the other $50 million for subsequent rounds. Under-reserving is a major risk, as it can leave a firm unable to support its most promising companies. VCs must also manage cash flow carefully, as management fees reduce the capital available for direct investment. Successful firms often "recycle" the profits from early exits back into the fund to ensure they can invest the full amount of committed capital.

### Cross-Fund Investing and Departing Partners
**Cross-fund investing** occurs when a firm invests in the same company from two different funds (e.g., Fund III and Fund IV). This is often done when an older fund lacks the reserves for a follow-on round, but it can create conflicts of interest between the LPs of the two different funds. Separately, a **key person clause** in the fund agreement specifies what happens if a key named partner leaves the firm. This can trigger a right for LPs to vote to halt new investments. When a partner who sits on your board leaves their firm, it is almost always a negative event for the company, which often loses a key champion and may be assigned a more junior, less-engaged board member as a replacement.

### Corporate and Strategic Investors
**Corporate Venture Capital (CVC)** groups are investment arms of large corporations (e.g., Salesforce Ventures, Intel Capital). Their motivations are often strategic as well as financial, which may lead them to pay higher valuations. However, they may also seek disadvantageous control terms, such as a **first right of refusal** on an acquisition, which entrepreneurs should never agree to. **Strategic investors** are other corporations that invest for a specific business reason (e.g., a key supplier or customer). To ensure their strategic help materializes, entrepreneurs can use a **performance warrant**, which grants the investor extra equity only after they meet specific, pre-agreed-upon performance milestones.

### Fiduciary Duties
VCs have legal **fiduciary duties** to multiple parties simultaneously: their investors (the LPs), their firm (the GP), and the companies on whose boards they serve. These duties can sometimes conflict, forcing the VC to navigate complex decisions. Entrepreneurs should remember that no matter how strong the personal relationship, their investors have a formal set of legal and financial obligations that ultimately guide their actions.
