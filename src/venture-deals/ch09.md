    def: "A measure of a company's total worth, often calculated in a venture context as its post-money valuation plus debt minus cash. It is considered a more complete assessment than simple equity valuation because it represents the theoretical price an acquirer would have to pay for the entire business."
takeaways: "Understanding a capitalization (cap) table is crucial for anyone involved in a startup, not just founders. The headline valuation of a deal doesn't tell the whole story; complexities like employee option pools and the conversion of debt can significantly dilute your ownership, impacting the real value of your equity."

### Understanding the Cap Table

A capitalization table, or "cap table," is a summary of who owns what percentage of a company. It is a critical document in any financing deal, as it details the ownership structure both before (pre-money) and after (post-money) an investment. Founders must understand how to read and model a cap table to accurately grasp the impact of a financing round on their own ownership stake.

### The Impact of an Employee Option Pool

Even a simple financing round becomes more complex with the addition of a new employee option pool. A term sheet will often require creating a pool of unissued stock options to attract future employees, and this pool is typically set as a percentage of the *post-money* capitalization. This has a significant dilutive effect on the founders.

For example, consider a company with a $10 million pre-money valuation that takes a $5 million investment. Without an option pool, the investors would own 33.33% of the company ($5M investment / $15M post-money). However, if the deal requires a 20% post-money option pool, the calculation changes. The founders' ownership becomes what's left over after the investors' and the option pool's shares are accounted for (100% - 33.33% - 20% = 46.67%). This means the founders' initial shares now represent a smaller percentage of a larger total number of shares. It is the entrepreneur's responsibility to understand this math, as errors can occur, and legal counsel may not always get it right.

### The Challenge of Convertible Notes

Calculating the cap table becomes substantially more complex when the company has previously raised money using convertible notes. These notes, which are essentially debt that converts into equity at the time of the financing, create ambiguity about who bears the dilution from the new shares issued to the noteholders. The key issue is that the noteholders often receive a discount on the price per share paid by the new investors, meaning they get more shares for their money. There are three common methods to resolve this, each with different outcomes for founders and investors.

**Method 1: The Pre-Money Method**

In this method, the agreed-upon pre-money valuation is held constant. The share price for the new investors is calculated based on this valuation, and the noteholders' conversion price is calculated by applying their discount to that price. The result is that both the founders *and* the new investors are diluted by the shares issued to the converting noteholders. While this is often the most common approach, new investors frequently dispute it because their final ownership percentage is lower than what they believe they bargained for (e.g., they end up with 17.5% instead of 20%).

**Method 2: The Percentage-Ownership Method**

In this method, the new investors' post-investment ownership percentage is held constant. To achieve this, the model works backward to determine the share price. This approach forces all the dilution from the note conversion onto the existing stockholders (the founders). This is the most dilutive scenario for founders and effectively results in a lower pre-money valuation than what was initially agreed upon. Entrepreneurs often object to this method unless it was explicitly detailed in the term sheet.

**Method 3: The Dollars-Invested Method**

This method is a compromise between the first two. Here, the post-money valuation is defined as the agreed-upon pre-money valuation *plus* the new cash from investors *plus* the principal and interest of the converting notes. This gives founders "credit" for the capital that came in via the notes. However, the founders alone are still diluted by the *discount* given to the noteholders. This method splits the difference, resulting in less dilution for founders than the Percentage-Ownership method but more than the Pre-Money method. The core challenge with any of these methods is that the presence of convertible notes effectively reopens the valuation discussion, requiring compromise from all parties to get the deal done.
