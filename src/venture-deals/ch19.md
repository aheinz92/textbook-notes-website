takeaways: "Understanding fundamental legal issues like intellectual property ownership, corporate structure, and equity grants is a core entrepreneurial responsibility, not just a task for lawyers. Getting these details right from the start prevents future conflicts, protects the company's value, and ensures a smoother path to funding and growth, regardless of whether the business is venture-backed."

### Introduction
Entrepreneurs consistently face a set of common legal hurdles. While some are minor hassles, others can have serious financial implications or even kill a deal. It is crucial for founders to understand these issues rather than simply delegating them to a lawyer.

### Intellectual Property
Early-stage intellectual property (IP) disputes can destroy a startup before it begins. Informal conversations about a business idea with a friend, collaborator, or classmate can lead to later claims of co-ownership. Even if the claim is weak, it can create enough uncertainty to stall or kill a venture financing deal.

These disputes are not limited to co-founders. A common issue arises with contractors hired to write code. Simply paying a contractor does not grant the company ownership of the resulting IP. A specific "work for hire" agreement is required to ensure the company owns the code.

While some entrepreneurs resort to secrecy or nondisclosure agreements (NDAs), a better approach is to be open with ideas but conscious of the audience. Once a business begins to form, it is critical to use competent legal counsel to properly document ownership and contributions to avoid future conflicts.

### Patents
A patent grants a 20-year monopoly to make, use, or sell an invention. The most common type, a utility patent, protects the functional aspects of a device. To be eligible, an inventor must file a patent application within 12 months of the first public disclosure or offer for sale.

Securing patents is an expensive and lengthy process with no guaranteed return. A provisional application costs between $2,000 and $10,000, while a full utility patent application can cost $10,000 to $25,000 and take several years to be reviewed. Founders must weigh this investment against the potential for creating a competitive advantage, especially in fast-moving markets where the technology could be obsolete by the time the patent is granted.

### Trademarks
A trademark protects a distinctive name, symbol, or tagline, preventing others from harming or capitalizing on a brand's goodwill. In the United States, trademark ownership is based on who was the first to *use* a mark, not the first to file for registration.

The process involves three steps:
1.  **Clearance:** A search is conducted to ensure the proposed mark is not already in use, including unregistered corporate and product names. This can cost $1,800 to $3,500.
2.  **Filing:** An application is filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (US PTO), typically costing $1,500 to $4,000.
3.  **Prosecution:** The mark is published for a period during which other entities can object to its registration.

### Employment Issues
Employment-related lawsuits are among the most common legal challenges for entrepreneurs. To mitigate risk, all hires should be designated as "at-will" employees, which clarifies that their employment can be terminated by either party for any legal reason. While pre-negotiating severance terms in an offer letter can provide clarity, it also reduces a company's flexibility during difficult financial periods. Founders should have a relationship with a good employment lawyer, and legal counsel is mandatory when a founder or executive departs to cleanly resolve equity and IP issues.

### Type of Corporate Structure
The choice of corporate structure depends heavily on financing plans.
- **C Corporation (C Corp):** This is the required structure for any company planning to raise venture capital or angel investment. It allows for multiple classes of stock (e.g., common and preferred) and is designed for reinvesting profits rather than distributing them.
- **S Corporation (S Corp):** For businesses not seeking VC funding, an S Corp is often ideal. It provides the liability protection of a corporation but has a "pass-through" tax structure, avoiding the potential double taxation of a C Corp.
- **Limited Liability Company (LLC):** Similar to an S Corp in its legal and tax characteristics, an LLC is less suitable for companies that plan to issue broad employee equity. Granting equity in an LLC involves "membership units" rather than stock options, which are more complex and less familiar to employees.

### Accredited Investors
U.S. securities laws restrict the sale of stock in private companies to "accredited investors" - individuals who meet certain income or net worth thresholds. Selling shares to non-accredited investors is a securities violation that creates a lifelong problem for the company. These investors gain a **right of rescission**, allowing them to demand a full refund for their shares at any time in the future, regardless of the company's performance.

### Section 409A Valuations
Section 409A of the IRS tax code requires that all employee stock options be issued with an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair market value (FMV) of the common stock. In the past, a company's board could set this price. Now, to gain "safe harbor" protection from significant IRS penalties, companies must hire an independent firm to perform a formal 409A valuation. This has created a new overhead cost for startups. A negative side effect is that these formal valuations often price common stock higher (e.g., 20-30% of preferred stock value, versus the old 10% rule of thumb), making options more expensive for employees and reducing their potential upside.

### 83(b) Elections
An 83(b) election is an IRS filing that is critical for anyone who receives restricted stock (stock that is subject to vesting). The election allows the recipient to be taxed on the value of the stock on the date it is *granted* rather than on the dates it *vests*. Since the stock value is typically lowest at the time of grant, this minimizes the tax liability. This filing is **time-sensitive and cannot be fixed if missed**; it must be filed with the IRS within **30 days** of the stock grant. Investors will verify that these filings have been made correctly during due diligence.

### Foundersâ€™ Stock
"Founders' stock" is not a special legal class of stock; it is simply common stock issued to founders at a very low price at the company's inception. To avoid tax complications, this stock should be purchased and finalized immediately upon incorporation. Founders should subject their own shares to a vesting schedule (e.g., four years with a one-year cliff) to protect the company and the other founders if one person leaves early. Vesting terms can also include acceleration clauses (single or double trigger) that cause vesting to speed up in the event of an acquisition.

### Consultants versus Employees
Companies must be careful when classifying service providers. Federal and state laws require that employees be paid at least minimum wage. Misclassifying an individual who is functioning as an employee as a "consultant" to avoid paying wages can result in significant liability for back pay, overtime, and penalties. A true consulting relationship should be structured for a specific project, be compensated by the project rather than by the hour, and allow the consultant to work for other clients without direct supervision from the company.

### Compensating Service Providers
Startups often use equity to compensate employees, advisors, and consultants to preserve cash. This is typically done through an equity incentive plan.
- **Stock Grants:** The recipient immediately becomes a stockholder. The fair market value of the stock is recognized as taxable income to the recipient in the year of the grant. This makes it less attractive for companies whose stock already has significant value.
- **Stock Options:** An option is the *right to buy* stock at a predetermined "exercise price" (the stock's FMV at the time of the grant). No tax is due at the time of the grant. The holder pays the exercise price to acquire the shares and only becomes a stockholder after exercising the option.
