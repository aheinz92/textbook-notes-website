terms:
  - term: "Zone of Insolvency"
    def: "A financial state where a company is nearly insolvent, meaning its liabilities are greater than its assets. When a company enters this zone, the board of directors' legal duty shifts from maximizing value for shareholders to preserving assets for the benefit of its creditors."
  - term: "Adverse Change Redemption"
    def: "A highly aggressive and founder-unfriendly term that gives investors the right to demand their money back (redeem their shares) if the company experiences a 'material adverse change.' Because 'adverse change' is often vaguely defined, this gives the investor a subjective trigger to pull their investment, which is why it is considered a predatory clause."
  - term: "Qualified IPO"
    def: "An Initial Public Offering (IPO) that meets a set of minimum criteria negotiated in the financing documents, typically a minimum amount of money to be raised (e.g., $50 million) and a minimum price per share. Upon the closing of a Qualified IPO, most of the special rights held by preferred stockholders (such as liquidation preferences and anti-dilution) automatically terminate as their shares convert into common stock."
  - term: "Secondary Market"
    def: "A market where shares of private companies are bought and sold. Unlike a public stock exchange, these transactions happen between private parties (e.g., founders selling to new investors) and are subject to company approval and rights of first refusal."
  - term: "D&O (Directors and Officers) Insurance"
    def: "A liability insurance policy that covers a company's directors and officers from personal financial losses if they are sued for alleged wrongful acts while managing the company. It is considered essential for attracting and protecting outside board members."
takeaways: "This chapter covers the 'long tail' of term sheet clauses that, while less critical than economics and control, can still have significant implications. Understanding these terms is valuable for any major negotiation, as it teaches the importance of reading the fine print, recognizing standard 'boilerplate' versus potentially problematic clauses, and understanding how these terms can protect you or create obligations in different scenarios, especially when things don't go as planned."

This chapter covers a series of terms in a term sheet that are generally less critical than economic and control terms but can be impactful in downside scenarios or signal an investor's mindset.

### Dividends
While common in private equity, dividends are less of a focus for most early-stage VCs because they don't significantly impact returns in a successful, high-growth "home run" exit. However, in a downside scenario or a sale with a low return multiple, cumulative dividends can become very material, increasing the investor's payout at the expense of common shareholders. For example, on a $40 million investment sold for $80 million after five years, a 10% cumulative dividend adds an extra $20 million to the investor's return. Entrepreneurs should be wary of automatic cumulative dividends paid in stock, as this acts as another form of antidilution, and should ensure that the declaration of any dividend requires board approval. Non-cumulative dividends that are only paid when declared by the board are generally benign.

### Redemption Rights
Redemption rights theoretically allow an investor to force the company to buy back their shares after a certain period (e.g., five years). The rationale is to provide an exit for VCs if a company becomes a stable but stagnant "lifestyle business" that is unlikely to IPO or be acquired, or if the VC fund is nearing the end of its 10-year life. In practice, companies that fit this description rarely have the cash to honor a redemption. The one clause to vehemently reject is an **adverse change redemption**, which allows investors to demand their money back based on a vague "material adverse change" to the business. This term is considered predatory and shifts an unreasonable amount of control to the investor.

### Conditions Precedent to Financing
A term sheet is not a binding commitment to invest. The "conditions precedent" section lists things that must be completed before the deal is final, such as satisfactory due diligence, legal documentation, and budget approval. This section explicitly states the VC can back out. Entrepreneurs should watch for specific, non-standard conditions that can be red flags:
* **Approval by investors' partnerships:** This means the VC who issued the term sheet does not yet have final approval from their own fund to do the deal.
* **Rights offering to be completed by company:** This requires offering the round to all previous investors, which can add time and expense.
* **Employment agreements signed by founders:** The key terms of these agreements (like compensation and termination clauses) should be understood and negotiated *before* signing a term sheet with a no-shop clause, not left as an open item.

### Information Rights
This is a standard and non-controversial term that legally requires the company to provide investors with regular financial statements (e.g., annual audited financials, quarterly unaudited financials) and budgets. Companies should run with transparency and expect to provide this information to their investors.

### Registration Rights
These rights detail how an investor’s shares will be handled in the event of an IPO, including "demand rights" (forcing the company to register shares for public sale) and "piggyback rights" (including their shares in a registration initiated by the company). While this section can be long and complex, its practical importance is often overstated. In a real IPO scenario, the investment bankers managing the offering will largely dictate the terms of the sale, often overriding the specific details negotiated years earlier in the financing agreements.

### Right of First Refusal (Pro Rata Rights)
Also known as **pro rata rights**, this is a standard term that gives investors the right to purchase their proportional share of any future equity issuance. This allows investors to maintain their ownership percentage as the company raises more capital. Entrepreneurs should seek to limit these rights to "major investors" (a status defined by a minimum investment size) to avoid the administrative complexity of managing small participants. It is also important to resist any attempts by VCs to secure "super pro rata rights," which would allow them to purchase *more* than their proportional share.

### Voting Rights
This is a straightforward clause stating that preferred stock votes alongside common stock on an as-converted basis, except where specific protective provisions grant the preferred stock a separate vote. The most important voting issues are handled in the protective provisions clause, not here.

### Restriction on Sales (ROFR on Common)
This gives the company, and by extension its investors, the right of first refusal (ROFR) to purchase any common stock that a founder or employee attempts to sell to a third party. This helps control who is on the company's capitalization table. While historically founders were discouraged from selling any shares before a company-wide liquidity event, the lengthening time to IPO has made founder secondary sales more common. This clause ensures the company and its investors have visibility and control over such sales.

### Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement
This is a critical and non-negotiable clause requiring all employees and consultants to sign an agreement confirming that all intellectual property (IP) created as part of their work for the company is owned by the company. This is essential for protecting the company's core assets and is a standard part of due diligence in any financing or acquisition.

### Co-Sale Agreement
This right is coupled with the ROFR on common stock. If a founder intends to sell shares, the co-sale agreement allows investors to participate in that sale on a pro rata basis. This prevents founders from creating a separate liquidity opportunity for themselves that is not available to their investors. While it is nearly impossible to eliminate, an entrepreneur can try to negotiate for a "floor" that allows for small sales (e.g., to buy a house) without triggering the co-sale right.

### Founders’ Activities
This clause requires founders to devote 100% of their professional time to the company. It serves as a check to ensure the founding team is fully committed. If a founder has other significant commitments, they should be disclosed and negotiated upfront via a specific carve-out.

### Initial Public Offering (IPO) Shares Purchase
This term gives investors the right to purchase a certain percentage of any "friends and family" shares offered in the company's IPO. In a hot, successful IPO, investment bankers often limit these programs, making the clause less relevant. If an IPO is struggling, bankers may be eager for insiders to buy shares, a situation investors typically want to avoid. It is not a term worth significant negotiation time.

### No-Shop Agreement
Once a term sheet is signed, this clause prevents the company from soliciting or negotiating with other potential investors for a fixed period (typically 30-60 days). It represents a mutual commitment to work in good faith toward closing the deal. Entrepreneurs should ensure the no-shop has a time limit, expires if the VC walks away, and ideally includes a carve-out for unsolicited acquisition offers. The authors stress that the character and integrity of the parties involved are more important than the legal enforceability of this term.

### Indemnification
This is a standard term requiring the company to protect (indemnify) its directors and officers from liability and legal costs arising from their roles. To fulfill this obligation, companies are expected to purchase Directors and Officers (D&O) liability insurance, which is a standard cost of doing business and necessary for attracting experienced outside board members.

### Assignment
This standard clause gives a VC fund the flexibility to transfer its shares to affiliated funds or partners. The key provision for the entrepreneur is to ensure that any party receiving the assigned shares (the "transferee") is also legally bound by all the terms and obligations of the original financing agreements.
