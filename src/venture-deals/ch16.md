  - term: "Escrow"
    def: "A portion of the purchase price that is placed with a neutral third party (an escrow agent) for a specific period after an acquisition closes. These funds serve as a security deposit for the buyer to make claims against if they discover that the seller breached any of the 'representations and warranties' about the business."
  - term: "Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)"
    def: "A form of equity compensation where an employee is promised a certain number of company shares to be delivered at a future date or upon meeting specific vesting conditions (e.g., length of employment). Unlike stock options, employees do not have to pay a 'strike price' to acquire the shares. As long as the company's stock has some value, RSUs are worth something upon vesting, making them a less risky form of compensation than options, which can become worthless if the stock price falls below the strike price."
takeaways: "An acquisition offer, formalized in a Letter of Intent (LOI), is far more complex than the headline price suggests. Unlike a venture financing where all parties can win together, an acquisition is a zero-sum negotiation over a fixed pie. Understanding how terms like escrow, working capital, earn-outs, and deal structure can dramatically alter the final cash outcome is a critical skill for any business owner, not just a venture-backed founder."

### Introduction to the Letter of Intent (LOI)
A Letter of Intent (LOI), also known as an indication of interest (IOI) or memorandum of understanding (MOU), is typically the first formal document a potential acquirer issues to a company it wishes to buy. While mostly non-binding, it outlines the key terms of a proposed acquisition. The negotiation of an LOI is a crucial first test of the relationship and negotiating style between the buyer and seller. Unlike a venture financing where value can be created for everyone over time, an acquisition is a negotiation over a fixed pie, which often makes the process more stressful and contentious.

### The Structure of a Deal: Price and Consideration
The two most important elements of an LOI are price and structure. The headline purchase price mentioned in early discussions or on the first page of the LOI is almost never the final amount received by the sellers. Several factors reduce the effective price:
* **Escrow (or Holdback):** A portion of the purchase price (e.g., $15 million out of $100 million) is held back by the buyer for a specified period to cover any undisclosed issues or breaches of contract that arise after closing. The amount and terms of the escrow are critical negotiation points.
* **Working Capital:** The buyer will often require the seller's company to be delivered with a minimum amount of working capital (current assets minus current liabilities). If the company's working capital is below this threshold at closing, the purchase price is directly reduced. This requirement should be negotiated to be zero for startups if possible.
* **Earn-outs:** These are future payments contingent on the acquired business meeting certain performance hurdles. While they can sound like a way to increase the price, they often function as a tool for the acquirer to pay less at closing and shift risk to the seller, with full value being paid only if specific, often difficult, targets are met.
* **Management Retention Pool:** Buyers often set aside a portion of the total consideration to incentivize key management to stay on after the acquisition. This amount is paid out over several years and is forfeited if an executive leaves. This can be a tactic by the buyer to create an early negotiating wedge between the company's management and its investors.

### Asset Deal vs. Stock Deal
The legal structure of the transaction is a critical issue. Sellers universally prefer a **stock deal**, while buyers often push for an **asset deal**.
* In a **stock deal**, the acquirer buys the seller's entire company, including all its assets and liabilities. The seller's corporate entity disappears, providing a clean break for its founders and investors.
* In an **asset deal**, the buyer purchases only specific assets (e.g., technology, patents, customer lists) and leaves the original corporate shell and its liabilities behind. This forces the seller to manage the wind-down of the remaining entity, which can be a multi-year hassle involving taxes, contracts, and potential legal exposure.
Though buyers claim asset deals offer more protection from unknown liabilities, a well-structured stock deal can provide functionally equivalent protection. Furthermore, courts are increasingly willing to impose "successor liability" on buyers in asset deals, diminishing the perceived protection. In distressed situations, sellers may have no choice but to accept an asset deal.

### Form of Consideration
The type of payment received matters immensely. **Cash is king** because its value is clear and immediate. Other forms of consideration are less certain and require deep scrutiny.
* **Public Company Stock:** If receiving stock in a public company, sellers must determine if it is freely tradable, subject to a lockup period, or if they will face selling restrictions as insiders.
* **Private Company Stock:** Receiving stock in a private company is riskiest. It is illiquid and its true value is diminished by the existing capital structure, particularly the amount and terms of any liquidation preferences held by the acquirer's own investors. An offer of "$15 million" in stock of a private company with $110 million in liquidation preferences may be worth significantly less.

### Assumption of Stock Options
Handling employee stock options is a complex part of an acquisition. Historically, option plans were automatically assumed by the buyer. Today, buyers have more flexibility and are not obligated to assume the plan. Key issues include:
* **Substitution:** Buyers may substitute options with other incentives like cash-backed plans or Restricted Stock Units (RSUs).
* **Revesting:** Acquirers may require key employees to "revest" their already-earned options, meaning they must remain with the new company for an additional period to receive their full value.
* **Barter Element (Strike Price):** The total value of options is the share price minus the strike price. Sellers often make the mistake of allowing the full gross value of unvested options to be deducted from the purchase price, rather than the net value (gross value minus the total strike price amounts). This effectively transfers value from the shareholders to the buyer. It's crucial to address these details in the LOI to avoid contentious, multi-party negotiations later.

### Key Legal and Procedural Terms
* **Representations, Warranties, and Indemnification:** The seller makes "reps and warranties" - factual statements about the business. If these prove untrue, the seller must provide **indemnification** (compensation) to the buyer for any losses. It's vital to specify in the LOI who makes these reps (the company, not individual shareholders) and to define the scope of indemnification rather than accepting vague "standard" terms.
* **Escrow:** This is the primary mechanism for satisfying indemnification claims. A typical escrow holds 10-20% of the purchase price for 12-24 months. The escrow should be the buyer's sole remedy for most breaches, with a few "carve-outs" (like fraud or taxes) that might allow for claims up to the total deal value.
* **Employee Matters:** Negotiation of individual compensation and employment packages for the management team should be deferred until after the LOI is signed. Negotiating these too early can create deal fatigue and misalign management's incentives with other shareholders.
* **No-Shop Clause:** Buyers will almost always insist on a binding "no-shop" clause, preventing the seller from soliciting other offers for a fixed period. Sellers should negotiate this period to be as short as possible, typically 45-60 days.
* **Fees:** The LOI will state that the seller is responsible for their own transaction costs (legal, banking, etc.). Breakup fees are rare in private company deals and should generally be resisted.
* **Registration Rights:** If receiving stock in a public company, it is often unregistered. The seller must negotiate for the buyer to register these shares with the SEC to make them sellable. However, this promise is non-binding, as the buyer does not control the SEC's timeline.
* **Shareholder Representative:** After a deal closes, a shareholder representative is appointed to manage any outstanding issues, such as escrow claims or earn-out calculations. This is a thankless and legally risky role. It is highly advisable to hire a professional firm to act as the shareholder representative rather than appointing a founder (who may have a conflict of interest working for the buyer) or a VC (who may be inattentive).
