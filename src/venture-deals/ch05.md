terms:
  - term: "Amortization"
    def: "The process of spreading the cost of an intangible asset (like a patent or trademark) over its useful life for accounting and tax purposes. It is similar to depreciation, which applies to tangible assets, and is a non-cash expense that can affect a company's reported profitability."
  - term: "Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)"
    def: "A valuation method used to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. The future cash flows are 'discounted' back to their present value to account for the time value of money and the investment's risk."
  - term: "Antidilution Carve-Out"
    def: "Specific exceptions to an antidilution provision. These are issuances of stock at a lower price that do not trigger the price adjustment for protected investors. Common examples include shares from an employee option pool or shares issued for strategic partnerships."
  - term: "Management Carve-Out"
    def: "A provision in a company sale agreement that sets aside a portion of the sale proceeds specifically for the management team. It is often used when the total sale price is too low to pay back all investors, ensuring key employees receive a financial reward for their work even if their common stock is worthless."
  - term: "Recapitalization"
    def: "The process of restructuring a company's debt and equity mixture. In a venture context, this often refers to a severe 'down round' financing that dramatically alters the ownership structure, frequently wiping out much of the value held by founders and early investors to make way for new capital."
  - term: "BATNA"
    def: "An acronym for 'Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement.' It is a negotiator's most advantageous alternative if the current negotiations fail. For an entrepreneur raising capital, having another investment offer is a strong BATNA that provides significant leverage."
  - term: "Section 83(b) Election"
    def: "A provision in the U.S. tax code that allows a founder or employee to pay taxes on the full value of their restricted stock at the time it is granted, rather than when it vests. By 'electing' to do this within 30 days of the grant, any future appreciation in the stock's value can be taxed at lower long-term capital gains rates."
takeaways: "A startup's valuation is only one piece of the economic puzzle in a financing deal. Key terms like the employee option pool, liquidation preference, and antidilution can dramatically alter the actual financial outcome for founders and employees, making it crucial to understand how these components interact to determine who gets what in a sale."

### Introduction: More Than Just Valuation
While valuation is a critical component of a venture capital deal, it is a mistake to focus on it exclusively. The true economic substance of a deal is shaped by a collection of terms, including valuation (price), liquidation preference, pay-to-play provisions, vesting schedules, the employee option pool, and antidilution protections. Understanding how these elements interact is essential for founders.

### Valuation and Price
Valuation determines the ownership percentage an investor receives for their investment and, consequently, the price per share. It's crucial to distinguish between **pre-money** and **post-money** valuation. The pre-money valuation is the company's worth before the investment, while the post-money valuation is the pre-money value plus the new investment amount. For example, a $2 million investment at a $6 million pre-money valuation results in an $8 million post-money valuation, with the investor owning 25% ($2M / $8M).

Entrepreneurs should be wary of ambiguity. When a VC offers to invest "$5 million at a $20 million valuation," they typically mean a $20 million *post-money* valuation, implying a $15 million pre-money value. An entrepreneur might mistakenly hear this as a $20 million *pre-money* valuation. It is wise to clarify this early by stating, "I assume you mean $20 million pre-money."

The term sheet links valuation to the price per share, often using the term **fully diluted**. This means all existing stock, granted options, warrants, and—importantly—the newly created shares for the employee option pool are included when calculating the price per share.

### Employee Option Pool
Before a financing, investors will want to ensure there is a sufficient employee option pool (typically 10-20% of the company's post-financing stock) to hire and retain talent. Critically, investors usually require this pool to be created *prior* to their investment. This means the dilution from creating these new options comes entirely from the existing shareholders (the founders), effectively lowering the pre-money valuation. For instance, if a company agrees to a $20 million pre-money valuation but has to increase its option pool by 10% (worth $2 million), the effective pre-money valuation drops to $18 million.

Negotiating the option pool is effectively negotiating the price. Entrepreneurs can counter by arguing for a smaller pool (supported by a detailed hiring plan or "option budget"), negotiating a higher pre-money valuation to compensate, or suggesting the pool be created post-financing (which investors rarely accept).

### Warrants
A warrant is a right for an investor to purchase shares at a fixed price for a specific period, similar to a stock option. They can be used by investors to effectively lower a company's valuation without changing the headline valuation number. While rare in early-stage equity deals, warrants are commonplace in **bridge loans**, where they are given to investors (along with a conversion discount) as a reward for providing capital ahead of a larger, defined financing round.

### How Valuation Is Determined
Valuation is more of an art than a science, influenced by numerous factors:
* **Stage of the company:** Early-stage valuations are driven by team, idea, and market size, while later-stage valuations rely more heavily on financial performance.
* **Competition:** Having multiple VCs interested in your deal is the most effective way to increase the valuation.
* **Team Experience:** Proven entrepreneurs command higher valuations.
* **Market Dynamics:** The size and "trendiness" of your market play a role.
* **VC's Strategy:** Some funds have specific valuation ranges they target.
* **The Numbers:** Financial metrics like revenue, burn rate, and projections become increasingly important as a company matures.
* **Economic Climate:** Macroeconomic trends can impact overall valuation levels.

Entrepreneurs should not take valuation negotiations personally but should focus on creating a competitive process by engaging multiple potential investors.

### Liquidation Preference
The liquidation preference is a critical economic term that dictates the payout order in a "liquidity event" such as a merger or acquisition. It determines how proceeds are split, which is especially important in scenarios where the company is sold for less than the total capital invested. It has two main components: the preference and the participation.

1.  **The Preference:** This is the amount an investor must receive before common stockholders get anything. It's typically a multiple of the original investment, with **1x** being the standard. A 1x preference means investors get their initial investment back first.

2.  **Participation:** This feature determines if investors get *more* money after their initial preference is returned. There are three types:
    * **Non-Participating (or "Simple Preferred"):** In a sale, the investor chooses the better of two outcomes: either (A) receive their liquidation preference (e.g., their 1x money back) or (B) convert their preferred stock to common stock and share in the proceeds pro-rata with founders. They do not get both.
    * **Full Participation:** The investor gets their liquidation preference back *and* then shares in the remaining proceeds on an as-converted basis with common stock. This is a "have your cake and eat it too" term that is highly favorable to investors.
    * **Capped Participation:** This is a hybrid. The investor receives their preference and then participates in the remaining proceeds, but only until their total return hits a predetermined cap (e.g., 3x their investment). Above that cap, the stock behaves like non-participating preferred.

When multiple financing rounds have occurred, preferences can be **stacked** (later-round investors get paid before earlier-round investors) or **pari passu** (all investors share pro-rata). The total preference amount that must be returned before founders see any return is called the **liquidation preference overhang**.

### Pay-to-Play
A pay-to-play provision requires existing investors to continue participating in future financing rounds to retain their preferred stock rights. If an investor with a pay-to-play clause does not invest their pro-rata share in a subsequent round (especially a down round), their preferred stock is converted to common stock, stripping them of special rights like their liquidation preference. This is generally a founder-friendly term as it aligns investors and ensures those who continue to support the company are the ones who retain preferential terms.

### Vesting
Vesting requires that stock or options be earned over a period of time. The standard for employees and founders is a four-year vesting schedule with a one-year "cliff." This means an individual must remain with the company for one year to receive the first 25% of their equity. The remaining 75% is then earned (vests) in monthly increments over the following three years. If someone leaves before their equity is fully vested, the unvested portion is returned to the company.

For founders, vesting aligns the founding team and protects the company if a co-founder leaves prematurely. VCs will almost always insist on putting vesting schedules on founder stock.

A related concept is **acceleration**, which determines what happens to unvested stock in an acquisition.
* **Single-trigger acceleration:** All unvested stock vests immediately upon a sale of the company.
* **Double-trigger acceleration:** Vesting is accelerated only if two events occur: the company is sold, *and* the employee is terminated by the acquirer. This is far more common, as acquirers want to incentivize the team to stay on after the acquisition.

### Exercise Period
When an employee with vested stock options leaves a company, the exercise period is the window of time they have to purchase their stock. Historically, this has been 90 days. If the options aren't exercised within this period, they are forfeited. There is a recent movement to extend this period, but the authors express concern that longer periods undermine the retention benefits of stock options.

### Antidilution
Antidilution provisions protect investors if the company later sells stock at a price lower than what they paid (a "down round"). This protection is achieved by adjusting the conversion price of the investor's preferred stock, effectively giving them more shares to compensate for the lower valuation.

There are two main types:
* **Full Ratchet:** The harshest form. If the company issues even one share at a lower price, the investor's original conversion price is repriced to that new, lower price.
* **Weighted Average:** The more common and founder-friendly method. It adjusts the conversion price based on a formula that considers both the lower price and the number of shares issued at that price. This results in a less severe adjustment than a full ratchet.

These provisions usually include standard "carve-outs" for certain issuances (like employee options) that do not trigger the antidilution adjustment. Entrepreneurs should not fight to eliminate this term but should ensure they receive the more moderate weighted-average version.
