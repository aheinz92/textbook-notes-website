### Why Hire an Investment Banker?

Deciding whether to sell a company is the responsibility of the board, CEO, and founders, not an investment banker. However, once the decision to seek an acquirer is made, a banker plays a critical role in managing the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) process.

There are situations where a banker is not needed, such as when a company receives a very attractive preemptive offer from a perfect acquirer, or in a low-value liquidation. Additionally, a CEO with extensive M&A experience and strong connections to logical acquirers may not find a banker's fees justifiable.

For most company sales, a banker adds significant value for several reasons:
1.  **Maximize Value**: A banker runs a broad "sell-side process," contacting 50 or more potential acquirers to create a competitive market, which maximizes the company's exit value. This thorough process also eliminates shareholder second-guessing about the final price.
2.  **Reduce Workload**: Selling a company is like taking on a second full-time job. A banker offloads logistical tasks like making initial calls, scheduling, updating presentations, and managing the online data room, allowing the executive team to continue running the business.
3.  **Act as a Buffer**: The banker can handle contentious negotiations, acting as the "bad guy" when needed. This preserves the long-term working relationship between the companyâ€™s executives and the acquiring team, which is crucial as the executives are often retained post-acquisition.

### How to Choose an M&A Adviser

For companies anticipating exits under $100 million, the options range from specialized boutique firms to smaller advisory firms. Choosing the right fit involves more than just perceived chemistry and should be guided by specific criteria:

* **Referrals and References**: The best candidates come from trusted sources like board members, investors, and colleagues. Hiring a banker without a strong endorsement is not recommended.
* **Specific Industry Expertise**: The banker must have deep knowledge of your specific sector (e.g., "enterprise SaaS," not just "technology"). Their initial outreach to potential acquirers must be credible and pitch-perfect.
* **Connections to Acquirers**: A good banker has a robust, current set of personal contacts within corporate development groups and among operating executives at likely buyers, not just superficial contacts with CEOs.
* **Deal Experience**: The adviser must have a proven track record of closing deals. The second half of an M&A process, involving negotiating the definitive agreement and completing due diligence, requires deep experience.
* **Personal Commitment**: Beware the "bait and switch," where a senior banker makes the pitch but a junior team executes the work. Get a direct commitment that the senior person will remain intimately involved in the entire process.
* **Cultural Fit**: The banker is a representative of your company. Their work style, values, and communication tools should be compatible with your own.

### Negotiating the Engagement Letter

The engagement letter is a complex, legally binding contract. It is essential to involve your lawyer and board in negotiating its terms. Key points to focus on include:

* **Scope of Work**: The letter must clearly define the services provided. This might be a core sell-side assignment, but could also include a "dual-track" process where the banker simultaneously seeks acquirers and minority investors. If fundraising is involved, the banker must be a licensed broker-dealer and member of FINRA (the governing body of the securities industry).
* **Success Fee**: This is the banker's primary compensation, paid only upon closing a deal. It's typically a percentage of gross proceeds, with the percentage decreasing as the deal size increases (e.g., up to 10% for small deals, declining to 1-2% for deals near $100 million). The formula may include incentive tiers for higher exit values. It is critical to model these fees in a spreadsheet to understand the potential payout and to specify how non-cash proceeds (like stock or an earn-out) will be handled.
* **Retainer and Expense Reimbursement**: Most engagements include a nonrefundable monthly retainer ($5,000 to $15,000) that signals the company's seriousness. This retainer should be fully deductible from the final success fee. Expenses should be capped, require pre-approval for major costs like travel, and conform to your company's policies. Only direct, out-of-pocket expenses should be reimbursed, not vague "administrative" overhead.
* **Term, Termination, and Tails**: A one-year term is standard. The contract should include a "termination for convenience" clause. Upon termination, a "tail" provision protects the banker's fee for a set period (typically 6-12 months) if the company closes a deal with a buyer the banker had substantive contact with.
* **Indemnification**: The company will be asked to indemnify the banker for actions taken on its behalf. This protection should not extend to the banker's reckless or grossly negligent actions. Disputes should be handled via mediation or arbitration rather than costly litigation.
* **Key Person Provision**: If you are hiring a bank for a specific individual's expertise, this clause allows you to terminate the engagement if that person leaves the firm.
* **Fairness Opinion**: This is a formal letter from the banker confirming a transaction's fairness to shareholders, acting as an insurance policy for the board. It is very expensive ($1M+) and generally overkill for typical venture-backed company sales. A broad, transparent M&A process is often a better defense against shareholder disputes.

### Helping Your Banker Maximize the Outcome

Signing the engagement letter is just the beginning. To ensure a successful process, the company must be fully aligned.

* **Board and Management Consensus**: The board of directors must be unanimous in its decision to sell. The senior management team must also be fully on board, as any internal dissent will be quickly spotted by potential buyers. For low-value exits, a "carve-out plan" can be used to allocate a portion of proceeds to key employees to align incentives.
* **Timetable and Execution**: All parties must agree to a common timetable to avoid process delays. While the banker manages the process, it is ultimately the CEO and the management team who must sell the company's vision and do much of the heavy lifting.
