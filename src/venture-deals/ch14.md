terms:
  - term: "Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA)"
    def: "A legal contract between two or more parties that outlines confidential material, knowledge, or information. It's used to prevent the sharing of this information with outside third parties. The chapter advises against asking VCs to sign one."
  - term: "Portfolio Companies"
    def: "The collection of companies that a venture capital fund has already invested in. A VC firm will often pass on a new investment if it competes directly with one of its existing portfolio companies."
  - term: "Business Method Patent"
    def: "A type of patent that seeks to protect a new method of doing business rather than a tangible invention. These are often controversial in the software industry, as they can cover abstract processes or ideas."
takeaways: "Fundraising from venture capitalists is as much about building a genuine human relationship as it is about pitching a great idea. Avoiding common mistakes—like being impersonal, asking for an NDA, or misinterpreting a 'no'—demonstrates professionalism and self-awareness, which are critical traits for success in any long-term partnership, business or otherwise."

### Don’t Be a Machine

Fundraising is ultimately about the people involved. VCs invest in entrepreneurs they personally like and connect with, seeking a "first date" energy where they are inspired by the founder. This is often called the "beer test"—if a VC wouldn't want to have a casual drink or coffee with you, they won't want to partner with you through the inevitable tough times of building a company. Since the average VC-entrepreneur relationship lasts longer than the average U.S. marriage, this personal connection is a critical foundation for the long-term commitment. Be human and let the investor get to know the real you.

### Don’t Ask for a Nondisclosure Agreement

Do not ask a venture capitalist to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA). VCs see a high volume of pitches and many similar ideas, so signing an NDA could create legal conflicts if they fund a competitor in the future. Reputable VCs will not steal your idea, as their reputation is their most valuable asset in the small, interconnected venture capital industry. An NDA also hinders a VC's ability to discuss your company with potential co-investors.

### Don’t Email Carpet-Bomb VCs

Sending mass, impersonal emails to a long list of VCs is a lazy and ineffective approach. This "carpet-bombing" signals to investors that you haven't done the basic homework to determine if they are a good fit for your company. Instead, your first communication should be thoughtful, personal, and strategic. A targeted, well-researched email to a specific partner makes a much better first impression.

### No Often Means No

While persistence is valued, when a VC clearly says they are not interested, you should respect their decision. A "no" is not a personal rejection and can happen for many reasons, such as the idea not fitting their investment thesis, the firm being too busy, or they simply don't believe in the idea. Every successful entrepreneur has been told no many times; it's part of the process.

### Don’t Ask for a Referral If You Get a No

When a VC passes on your company, do not ask them for a referral to another investor. This puts the VC in an awkward position, as they are simultaneously rejecting your company while being asked to implicitly endorse it to a colleague. This "conflicted referral" is not valuable to you, as the receiving investor will know the referring VC passed on the deal. The one exception is if you have a pre-existing relationship and the reason for the "no" is specific to the fund's strategy (e.g., your company is too early-stage for them). In that case, you may respectfully ask for a suggestion, but do not push if they decline.

### Don’t Be a Solo Founder

Raising venture capital as a solo founder is extremely difficult. VCs invest in teams for several reasons. First, no single person possesses all the skills required to build a company. Second, an inability to convince at least one other person to join your mission is a red flag about your idea or your leadership ability. Third, the quality of the team is often more important than the idea itself; VCs consistently bet on A-grade teams with B-grade ideas over the reverse. The rare exception is a proven, repeat entrepreneur who a fund has worked with before and trusts to build a team post-funding.

### Don’t Overemphasize Patents

For most software companies, patents are not a primary driver of value and should not be the centerpiece of your pitch. Success in software is about great execution, a strong team, and building a product users love, not about patent protection. Patents are, at best, a defensive tool. Over-relying on them signals that you may not understand the software business or that you haven't researched the specific investors you are pitching, many of whom are skeptical of software and business method patents.

### Don’t Be Silent If You Witness Bad Behavior

The venture capital ecosystem must not tolerate sexual harassment or any other form of abusive behavior. If you witness or are the subject of such behavior from an investor, it is critical to speak up. It is a collective responsibility for everyone in the industry to help identify and remove bad actors.
