terms:
  - term: "Product Hunt"
    def: "A website where users share and discover new technology products. It's a popular platform for startups to launch, gain visibility, and get feedback from an audience of tech enthusiasts and early adopters."
  - term: "Google Search Console"
    def: "A free service offered by Google that helps website owners monitor their site's performance in search results, identify technical issues, and submit information like 'disavow files' to manage how Google interacts with their site."
  - term: "Vesting Rate"
    def: "In the context of a subscription business, this refers to the rate at which new customers are successfully converted into long-term, loyal, paying subscribers who don't cancel after their initial trial or first few billing cycles."
takeaways: "Launching a 'Minimum Viable Product' (MVP) can be dangerous for established brands or projects with high visibility, as it can create a 'MVP hangover' that damages reputation. For any project, whether in a startup or a large company, it's crucial to weigh the benefits of speed against the risk of making a poor first impression; sometimes, waiting to release an 'Exceptional Viable Product' (EVP) is the smarter long-term strategy."

### The Problem with "Minimally Viable"
While the "lean startup" movement's concept of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is powerful for learning and iterating quickly, it often leads to the creation of low-quality, barely useful products. The author challenges the mantra "If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late," arguing that this approach can be harmful.

### Case Study 1: The Spam Score MVP
In 2014-2015, Moz developed an MVP called "Spam Score" to help SEO professionals identify potentially harmful websites. The team knew customers wanted a definitive tool, but lacked the resources to build it. Instead, they launched an MVP based on 17 "spam flags"—factors that correlated with sites penalized by Google. The team was aware of the MVP's weaknesses before launch: it wasn't comprehensive, its risk model was confusing, and it wasn't what customers had explicitly asked for.

The launch confirmed these fears. While some found it useful, it also generated significant criticism and confusion. Influential experts, like Marie Haynes, expressed concern that it could do more harm than good. Six months later, the data showed Spam Score had no observable positive impact on Moz's core business metrics like trials, retention, or growth. The project, which cost at least $500,000, was effectively a failure that provided little new learning, as customer research had already revealed what a truly great product would look like.

### The "MVP Hangover"
When a company with an established brand and a large audience launches an MVP, customers don't see it as a work-in-progress. They judge it as a finished product, and if it's not excellent, it damages the brand's reputation. The author calls this the "MVP hangover"—a negative perception that sticks with a product and the parent brand for years, even long after the product is improved.

This dynamic creates a distinction for when MVPs are appropriate:
* **Good for Startups:** An early-stage company with a small audience and low expectations can use an MVP to learn and iterate, improving its product as its reputation grows.
* **Bad for Established Brands:** A company with a large following and high expectations risks significant brand damage by releasing a subpar product. Examples like Tesla show that some companies cannot afford to launch anything less than extraordinary. Microsoft's Bing is cited as a product that, despite its quality today, still suffers from the MVP hangover of its initial launch.

### The Alternative: An Exceptional Viable Product (EVP)
The proposed alternative is the "Exceptional Viable Product" (EVP). The strategy is to still build an MVP internally, but to test and iterate on it privately with a select beta audience. The product should only be launched publicly once it is refined to the point of being exceptional and truly impressive to its target market.

### Case Study 2: The Keyword Explorer EVP
Following the disappointing launch of Spam Score, Rand Fishkin led a project to build a new keyword research tool, Keyword Explorer. Motivated by his CEO’s candid feedback that he wasn't a good product designer, Fishkin was determined to prove he had learned from past mistakes. He began with extensive research, using surveys, interviews, and face-to-face observation of SEO professionals. This process confirmed the market's needs and the ideal feature set for a superior tool. As a long-time SEO practitioner himself, the his own experience gave him well-tuned empathy for what customers wanted.

After months of development, the team had a functional MVP. However, when Fishkin showed the tool to industry experts like Dan Shure, the feedback was that the product was intuitive but ultimately underwhelming and missing critical features. Based on these private demos, the difficult decision was made to delay the public launch. Fishkin and his team spent an additional four months building out the features required to make the product truly exceptional.

The public launch of the completed Keyword Explorer was a massive success. The tool received overwhelmingly positive reviews, was the second-most upvoted product on Product Hunt on its launch day, and drove significant user adoption. Crucially, business metrics showed that its use correlated strongly with customer retention. This success demonstrated the power of waiting to release a product that is exceptional rather than just minimally viable, especially for a brand with an established reputation.
