takeaways: "Self-awareness practiced as an ongoing, behavior-focused process is a practical antidote to founder anxiety and poor decision-making. You can’t control outcomes, but you can control the habits, analysis, and investments that improve your odds and safeguard your mental health. That shift, from outcome-chasing to behavior investment, applies to startups, careers, and personal well-being."

### From Isolation to Recognition
At Foundry Group’s CEO Summit, nearly every CEO admitted to serious anxiety or depression, replacing isolation with solidarity and reframing mental-health struggles as common, workable realities of leadership. Rand’s own episode recast a previously friendly, optimistic leader into an argumentative pessimist who used “depressive realism” as intellectual cover for doom-laden judgments. The spiral showed up physically (worsened sciatica) and behaviorally (insomnia, rage, a self-blaming mental “loop”).

As Moz stumbled after the Moz Analytics missteps, Sarah Bird (an operationally strong, values-driven leader) became CEO while Rand shifted to individual-contributor work. A sudden stretch of deep sleep briefly broke the loop, revealing the connection among rumination, pain, and rest; gradual improvement followed as Moz stabilized (including Moz Local’s launch) and as public writing plus peers’ candor provided catharsis. There’s no simple cure offered - only the recognition that no one is alone and that progress comes from sustained self-awareness.

### Practicing Self-Awareness: Honest Inquiry and Revealed Motives
Work with coach Jerry Colonna underscored that no one is fully self-aware or fully company-aware; awareness lives on a spectrum and requires daily inquiry. Progress demands intellectual honesty (questioning cherished beliefs, noticing biases, and discarding comforting narratives when facts diverge) because both personal and company postmortems often lean on instinct and supposition. Stripping assumptions exposed an uncomfortable truth: a craving for a public, celebrated “exit,” rooted in impostor syndrome and fear that prior success was luck. A thought experiment (would a spectacular but secret sale satisfy?) revealed how much external validation mattered. Naming the truth to oneself and stakeholders weakens its grip; after admitting it, the fear eased, a quiet outcome felt acceptable, and starting anew felt possible.

### Behaviors, Not Outcomes: A Playbook for Mental Health and Management
You control behavior; you never fully control outcomes. Outcome-focused rewards can punish good process when luck runs against you or reinforce bad habits when luck runs with you. Fighting depression mirrored this: a grab bag of tactics (therapy, exercise, physical therapy, “anti-work night,” etc.) were prematurely discarded when they didn’t produce an immediate cure. Reframed as behavioral investments, the helpful ones returned and stuck; at Moz, the team likewise invested in behaviors like internal MVPs and iterative improvement while dropping performance reviews that didn’t serve them. Worthwhile behaviors tend to be intrinsically rewarding, aligned with values, easier with repetition, measurably (even modestly) causal in positive impact, and not consistently linked to negative outcomes.

Reward the work, not the scoreboard (whether in weight loss or startups) because outcome-tied incentives invite shame, gaming, and risk-taking, while behavior-tied incentives support persistence and integrity. This shift restores agency and reduces fear of relapse by focusing on controllable levers: diet, exercise, physical therapy, ongoing self-awareness, breaks from work, and self-forgiveness. Feelings aren’t facts, and strategy and vision are malleable; by understanding ourselves and our creations, choosing better behaviors, and using outcomes as feedback rather than trophies, we make wiser, more humane decisions.
