terms:
  - term: "Institutional Investors"
    def: "Organizations that pool large sums of money to invest in assets like stocks, bonds, and private companies. Examples include pension funds and university endowments, which are often the primary source of capital for venture capital funds."
  - term: "S&P 500"
    def: "The Standard & Poor's 500, a stock market index that tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly-traded companies in the U.S. It is commonly used as a benchmark to measure the performance of other investments, like a VC fund."
takeaways: "Raising money from venture capitalists isn't just about getting capital; it's about committing to a specific, high-risk path that demands a billion-dollar outcome. Understanding the VC model - where only a few massive wins pay for all the losses - is critical because it creates a potential for severe misalignment between a founder's personal goals and an investor's financial necessities."

### Introduction: The Allure and the Cost of Fundraising
Fundraising can seem like the pinnacle of entrepreneurial success, bringing press, prestige, and financial resources. However, raising money from institutional investors can be a terrible decision if your business is not 100% aligned with their unique model. The author, Rand Fishkin, reflects on his experience raising a total of $29.1 million for his company, Moz. While the process made him a more focused and ambitious entrepreneur, his perspective has shifted from a definite "yes" to a hesitant "I really hope not" when considering future fundraising. This change is due to two primary factors: the brutal odds of success and the high personal and professional cost involved.

### I Mean, You Don’t *Technically* Sign the Deal in Blood
Founders often operate under the delusion that they and their investors are on the same team with perfectly aligned interests. The reality is that an investor's incentives shift over time based on how your company performs relative to the other bets in their portfolio. Startup investing follows the Pareto principle: roughly 20% of investments generate 80% of the returns. For a typical venture fund, out of ten investments, five will fail completely, three will return insignificant amounts, and only two will generate the bulk of the fund's gains.

An investor's attention and support will be lavished on your company only if it looks like one of those two big winners. If it appears to be one of the other eight, their interest will wane, and their involvement may feel more like a chore. One of an investor's primary tools for managing a company's performance - either to protect a winner or recover a flailing investment - is to replace the CEO. The venture capital model is explicitly not for founders who want to build a stable, profitable business that affords them work-life balance. It is exclusively for those willing to grind relentlessly in pursuit of a rare, billion-dollar "moonshot" outcome, despite the terrible odds.

### How VCs Lose, Even When They Win
The misalignment between founders and investors is rooted in the mathematics of the venture capital business model. While 30-40% of startups fail completely, a staggering 95% fail to deliver the *expected return* for their investors. To understand this, one must understand how VC firms work. They raise capital from Limited Partners (LPs) - such as endowments and pension funds - by promising to deliver returns that beat the public markets, typically targeting a 3x return on their entire fund over a ten-year period.

Only about 5% of VC firms actually achieve this goal, and they do so through enormous outcomes from a tiny number of their portfolio companies. A "good" outcome for a founder, such as selling a company for $40 million, can be a "useless return" for a VC. A $5.6 million return on a $1 million investment, as in the Moz example, does not meaningfully contribute to the goal of turning a $300 million fund into $900 million. This creates scenarios where VCs might block a $450 million acquisition - a life-changing sum for the founders and employees - because it doesn't get the fund closer to its overall $1.2 billion target. Letting the company sell for "only" $450 million is a failure in the eyes of the VC's mathematical model.

### The Great Misalignment
Anyone considering raising venture capital must understand and accept this risk model. If you are not comfortable pursuing high-risk strategies that could kill your business nine out of ten times in the hope of becoming a unicorn, you are not aligned with your investors. Alignment means committing to a long-haul journey to build a company with hundreds of millions in revenue or users, and saying no to early acquisition offers that could make everyone a millionaire. This journey is also getting longer, with the average time from founding to a successful IPO now taking around eleven years.
