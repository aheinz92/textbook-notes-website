takeaways: "Forcing skilled individual contributors into management as the only path for career advancement is a recipe for disaster, as it misaligns talent and creates incompetence (the Peter Principle). A better approach is to create dual career tracks where both ICs and People Managers have equivalent opportunities for growth in influence, prestige, and compensation, allowing people to excel in roles best suited to their skills."

### The Rush to Management
After Moz raised $18 million in a Series B round, the company went on a hiring spree. This influx of cash and new roles created an unexpected side effect: a surge of requests from the company's best individual contributors (ICs) to become people managers. Of the roughly 40 non-management employees, 25 asked to build and lead their own teams. This created a political environment that had not existed before, slowing down product development as anxiety around team structure and promotions distracted from core work.

### Managing Is a Skill, Not a Prize
This situation illustrates the "Peter Principle," where employees are promoted based on performance in their current role until they reach a position where they are no longer competent. The core challenge is what to do with a high-performing IC who wants to become a manager to advance their career. Promoting them means losing their valuable individual contributions and risking they may be a poor manager; refusing the promotion risks losing them to another company.

The belief that anyone can be a people manager, or that the best ICs will inherently be the best managers, is a fallacy. People management is a distinct skill set. Research from Google's re:Work program identified eight key behaviors of effective managers - the most important were being a good coach, empowering the team without micromanaging, and expressing interest in team members' well-being. Having "important technical skills" to advise the team was ranked last on the list. In fact, when managers lack deep technical skills, team members often step up to mentor one another, fostering broader skill development and less reliance on a single person's methods. People management and IC work are two different jobs, and proficiency in one does not guarantee proficiency in the other.

### Don’t Make Management the Only Ladder to Climb
The solution is to dismantle the misconception that management is the only path to leadership or career advancement. Moz addressed this by creating a formal, dual-track career pathing system for all roles, not just engineering. This system, illustrated in the chapter's chart, allows Individual Contributors to advance in title, influence, compensation, and stock options on a track parallel to People Managers. An "Architect" level IC, for example, holds equivalent pay, influence, and expectations as a C-level executive on the management track. While this was celebrated in theory, it required significant work to overcome the default belief that managers hold all the "real power" through their ability to hire and fire. In modern tech workplaces, however, skilled workers often have more leverage than their employers, diminishing the power of such threats.

### Individual Contributors Don’t Deserve to Be Second-Class Citizens
For a dual-track system to be credible, the IC path cannot be seen as a lesser alternative. It requires deliberate, reinforcing pillars to establish its legitimacy. These pillars include:
1.  **Visible Role Models:** Leadership must regularly and publicly recognize high-level ICs.
2.  **Access and Interface:** Senior ICs must have regular, direct interaction with staff across the company.
3.  **Real Influence:** ICs must be granted authority to guide initiatives, advise on processes, and have the final say in their areas of expertise.

Even with these efforts, biases can persist. The key is to grant accountability alongside the control necessary to achieve results. Moz created specific high-level IC roles to solve this. A "Product Architect," for instance, is responsible for a product's success and directs the work without being a people manager. A "Subject Matter Expert" advises multiple teams and makes critical calls in their domain, holding influence and compensation on par with VP-level managers. Every organization can benefit from creating such expert IC roles tailored to its own needs, ensuring that the best people are in the right positions to contribute their unique skills without being forced onto a management track that doesn't fit.
