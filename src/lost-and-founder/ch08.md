terms:
  - term: "IPO (Initial Public Offering)"
    def: "The process by which a private company becomes a public one by selling shares of its stock to the general public for the first time. It is a common type of 'exit' that allows founders and early investors to liquidate their ownership and receive cash."
  - term: "Total Compensation"
    def: "The complete pay package for an employee, which includes base salary plus the value of any bonuses, benefits, and stock or stock options. It is often shortened to just 'comp.' In startups, a high on-paper value of illiquid stock may be included in total compensation to justify a lower cash salary."
  - term: "Portfolio Companies"
    def: "The collection of different companies that a single venture capital fund or investment firm has invested in. Investors often leverage data and experiences from across their entire portfolio to advise their companies."
takeaways: "Founding a startup, even one that becomes successful by many metrics, is not a reliable path to personal wealth due to the illiquid nature of private stock and the long, uncertain timeline to an exit. The primary rewards for most founders are more likely to be accelerated career growth, skill development, and the freedom to pursue a mission, not a quick financial payout."

The common belief that founding a successful startup is a ticket to instant wealth is a myth. The author, Rand Fishkin, uses his own experience at Moz—drawing a substantial salary but not possessing the liquid wealth many assume—to illustrate that owning a large amount of private stock does not equate to cash in the bank. This chapter serves as a statistical and anecdotal reality check on the financial outcomes for founders, contrasting the media hype with the much more common and difficult reality.

### Even Successful Startup Founders Don’t Get Rich (Quick)
The financial rewards in the startup world are disproportionately distributed to a tiny fraction at the very top. For most founders and early employees, taking below-market-rate salaries in the early years means they may be financially worse off than peers at established tech companies like Google or Microsoft. A founder's ownership is in the form of illiquid common stock. Unlike investors who hold preferred stock (with special rights like getting paid out first) or employees with stock options, founders cannot easily convert their ownership to cash. Selling private stock is difficult due to the high risk of startup failure, SEC regulations limiting buyers to "accredited investors," and a lack of public financial data about the company. Furthermore, investors and boards often discourage founders from selling their shares, believing that keeping them "hungry" and fully invested ensures their motivation is tied to a future "exit" event like a sale or IPO. Founders also cannot simply pay themselves a huge salary; CEO compensation is set by the board of directors, which uses market data and often factors in the founder's illiquid stock ownership to justify a lower cash salary.

### It Takes a Lot of 7s and a Long Time to Win at Startup Roulette
Starting a company is a gamble where you trade the certainty of a market-rate salary for the mere hope of a massive future payout. The stories of quick, multi-million dollar exits are statistical outliers. The reality is that startups take a long time to mature and provide a return, if they ever do. Moz, for example, was over a decade old and still hadn't provided a cash return to its investors or employees at the time of writing. Following the advice of venture capitalist Mark Suster, founders and employees should view their stock as "icing on the cake," not the primary motivation or something to be counted on. The "on paper" value of private stock is often an illusion, as it cannot be sold until a specific liquidity event occurs, which is largely outside the founder's control.

### The Real Rewards of a Startup
Despite the poor odds of getting rich, there are excellent reasons to found a company. The primary benefits are non-financial: the freedom to pursue a specific mission, the autonomy to decide what to work on, and the power to shape a company's culture and team. More practically, working at a startup—even one that fails—can massively accelerate one's career. Startups force individuals to become self-motivated, multi-talented, and efficient. Demonstrating the ability to build a product, execute a strategy, and lead a team makes you a highly desirable commodity in the job market. This is why many small companies are acquired specifically for their talented teams in transactions known as "acquihires." A startup can be a powerful way to level up your skills and increase your future earning potential, but it should be seen as a labor of passion, not a get-rich-quick scheme.
