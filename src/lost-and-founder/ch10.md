takeaways: "True company values are not empty slogans; they are principles you are willing to sacrifice short-term profit for. For any career path, understanding this distinction is key to identifying authentic, high-performing organizations and highlights how a combination of shared ethics and diverse life experiences—not shared backgrounds—is the true foundation of innovation and long-term success."

### Values Over Short-Term Profit
A tension exists between upholding core values and pursuing short-term financial gain. At Moz, a proposal was made to reduce customer churn by requiring a phone call to cancel a subscription, rather than allowing a single click online. This change would likely have been profitable, but it was rejected for conflicting with the company's value of empathy. Real values are defined by the willingness to sacrifice money or growth to uphold them. Sticking to values can be frustrating for a struggling startup, but it is invaluable for long-term success and employee morale.

### Moz's TAGFEE and the Purpose of Core Values
Moz's six core values are represented by the acronym TAGFEE: **T**ransparency, **A**uthenticity, **G**enerosity, **F**un, **E**mpathy, and the **E**xception. These values, developed by the early team, act as a litmus test for decisions across the company. The idea was inspired by Jim Collins's book *Good to Great*, which found that great companies are built by people who share fundamental core values. These shared beliefs provide three powerful organizational forces:
1.  **Shared Commitment:** They act as a unifying foundation for the team, even amidst disagreements on tactics or goals.
2.  **Decision-Making Blueprints:** They serve as guardrails, helping to navigate difficult choices, like the cancellation policy example.
3.  **Evaluation Criteria for Retrospection:** They provide a non-financial lens for looking back on past projects, reinforcing the values and improving future decisions.

### Hiring for Values: The Competence vs. Culture Fit Matrix
A common and disastrous mistake is to hire a highly competent person who is not a fit for the company's values, believing they can be changed. You cannot "install" core values in people; you must find people who are already predisposed to share them. The goal is to attract and retain those who align and let those who don't go elsewhere. A 2x2 matrix plotting Competence vs. Culture Fit clarifies this. Companies correctly hire "high competence/high fit" people and reject "low competence/low fit" people. However, they make two common errors: they keep "high competence/low fit" people (who should be let go) and they fail to keep and train "low competence/high fit" people (who should be developed). A hiring process must screen for values alignment from the start.

### How Values Fail
Core values require constant vigilance to remain meaningful. They fail in three common ways:
1.  **They become paper platitudes:** Values are stated but not enforced, especially when they conflict with a high-performing employee's behavior. This signals that performance matters more than values.
2.  **They are manipulative marketing:** Values like "hustle" or "get shit done" are chosen to create a cult-like environment for recruiting, rather than being genuine, deeply-held beliefs that the company would uphold even at a competitive disadvantage. Real values have real costs.
3.  **They are unstated and secret:** When values aren't explicit, employees must learn the "unwritten rules" through trial and error. This is frustrating and guarantees that you lose the benefits of explicitly recruiting for people who share your beliefs.

### Homogeneity Hobbles Innovation: Values Fit is NOT Uniformity
Seeking shared values must not lead to a lack of diversity. Building a team with shared values and diversity of background, experience, and identity is a massive competitive advantage—a "cheat code." A diverse team brings unique life experiences that improve perspective, empathy, and creativity, leading to better products and decisions, as seen in several examples from Moz:
* Early gender diversity helped attract top female talent that would have been inaccessible to an all-male company.
* Diverse perspectives on product personas led to more inclusive product design that better reflected the actual customer base.
* Employees from different backgrounds identified and corrected non-inclusive language (e.g., changing "brown bag" to "lunch and learn").
* Team members with different physical abilities (color-blindness, dyslexia) and life experiences (pregnancy) identified crucial accessibility and design flaws in products and office design.

Research from McKinsey and First Round Capital confirms this, showing that more diverse teams consistently outperform their homogenous peers financially.

### Building a Diverse Team with Shared Values
Founders often default to hiring people like themselves, which limits perspective and makes it harder to recruit diverse employees later. The key is to seek overlap in ethical beliefs, not in personal backgrounds or interests. Interview questions should not be about pop culture preferences but should instead probe how candidates think about what behaviors deserve reward, how conflicts should be resolved, and what enables their best work. To solve its own challenges with this, Moz implemented two key processes:

1.  **The "TAGFEE Screen":** Candidates are interviewed by a cross-functional group who are not on the hiring team. This group specifically evaluates the candidate's alignment with Moz's values and has the power to veto a hire, even if the candidate has perfect skills for the role.
2.  **Intentional Diversity Sourcing:** Moz actively invested in programs like Returnship (for parents returning to work) and Ada Developers Academy (for women learning to code) to gain exposure to a more diverse pool of candidates beyond internal referrals.

These changes led to measurable improvements in employee retention, team cohesion, and the diversity of the company.
